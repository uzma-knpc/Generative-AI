An important and essential element in the control of such releases is to conduct continuous monitoring, both at the source of discharge and in the recipient environment, to ensure protection from harmful effects of ionizing radiation. Regulations 8(6) and 8(10) of PNRA Regulations for Licensing of Nuclear Installations in Pakistan - (PAK/909) (Rev.1) require submission of Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) for approval by the Authority along with the application for obtaining permission to introduce nuclear material into the installation and for obtaining license for decommissioning/closure of the installation respectively. This Regulatory Guide (RG) provides guidance on format and content for the preparation of EMP.\\n\\n2. OBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective of this RG is to facilitate the licensee of NIs in preparation of EMP in a harmonized manner and to facilitate PNRA personnel in conducting orderly review of EMP during licensing process.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThis RG is applicable to NIs for the preparation of EMP for normal operation, emergency, decommissioning and closure stage in accordance with the prescribed format and content.\\n\\n4. FORMAT AND CONTENT OF EMP\\n\\nThe licensee should develop its EMP, by adopting and implementing applicable guidance provided in this RG, commensurate with the level of radiation risk associated with its facility i.e. by applying graded approach. The licensee should prepare and submit its EMP to the Authority, for approval, in accordance with the content given in the subsequent sections.\\n\\n4.1 General Instructions for Preparation of EMP\\n\\nThe licensee should follow the following instructions for preparation of EMP: i. ii. A table of contents including figures, tables, annexes, etc. along with page\\n\\nProvide clear, concise, factual and latest/updated information;\\n\\nnumbers should be included;\\n\\niii. Definitions and abbreviations should be consistent throughout the document; iv. Duplication of information should be avoided. In case where necessary,\\n\\nreference of relevant section should be made; and\\n\\n1\\n\\nv. Legible drawings, diagrams, layouts, maps, and tables should be added,\\n\\nwherever necessary, with proper reference.\\n\\n4.2 Content of EMP\\n\\nFollowing should be the general content of an EMP:\\n\\n4.2.1 Introduction\\n\\nIn this section, the licensee should briefly introduce the EMP.\\n\\n4.2.2 Objective\\n\\nIn this section of the program, the licensee should describe objectives to be\\n\\nachieved through preparation and implementation of the EMP.\\n\\n4.2.3 Scope\\n\\nThis section should describe the scope of the EMP.\\n\\n4.2.4 Description of the Facility\\n\\nThis section should include sufficient information about the NIs including its name, purpose, type, location along with the longitude and latitude, date of commencement of operation or decommissioning or closure (whichever is applicable), and area under administrative control of the licensee. It should also describe anticipated radioactive discharges, their types, principal radionuclides involved, discharge points and preoperational environmental monitoring study.\\n\\n4.2.5 Organization Structure\\n\\nThis section should include licensee\\'s organizational structure along with the responsibilities of all individuals involved in environmental monitoring. The information regarding interfaces (if any) between different divisions/groups involved in environmental monitoring should also be addressed.\\n\\n4.2.6 Site Characteristics\\n\\nThis section should describe information of the site that is used to establish the EMP e.g. flora and fauna etc. The areas where radionuclides might accumulate due to release of activity from other facilities at the same site should also be identified.\\n\\n4.2.7 Metrological Conditions\\n\\nThe section should include the metrological conditions of the site that is used to\\n\\n2\\n\\nestablish the EMP such as wind speed, wind direction, etc.\\n\\n4.2.8 Demography and Living Habitat\\n\\nThis section should describe population distribution, population density, largest and nearest population center, life expectancy around the facility. It should describe the habitat of public including living habits, occupancy factor, human utilization of environmental media to be affected by discharges and fraction of consumption of local food.\\n\\n4.2.9 Exposure Pathways for the Site\\n\\nThis section should include all possible exposure pathways including inhalation,\\n\\ningestion and direct radiation for all age groups on the site.\\n\\n4.2.10 External Radiation Monitoring\\n\\nThis section should include information regarding identification of monitoring points, justification for their selection and the map of the identified locations.

Since, radiology is an important tool for diagnosis, therefore, diagnostic procedures have become routine part of clinical life and the number of such procedures is ever increasing. Keeping in view the diversity of patients and nature of their examinations, dose limits are not applicable in diagnostic procedures. In fact, the guidance levels are established for radiological procedure so that required clinical information for diagnosis may be obtained at a reasonable amount of radiation dose; which is the ultimate goal of “optimization in patient doses”.\\n\\nThe patient doses are affected by a number of parameters such as equipments, techniques and expertise. This regulatory guide addresses the appropriateness of operating parameters such as mAs, kVp and; equipments including grid, collimator and image receptors; techniques like general radiography, mammography and fluoroscopy; and knowledge/skills of operating personnel. In addition to this, various administrative issues such as responsibilities and training of workers have also been addressed in this regulatory guide.\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................1 OBJECTIVE ...............................................................................................................1 SCOPE ...............................................................................................................1 PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION PROTECTION AND PATIENT SAFETY .........1 Justification ........................................................................................................1 4.1. 4.2.

According to United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), there are over 3.6 billion medical radiation imaging procedures carried out annually. According to survey conducted by UNSCEAR for the period from 1997-2007, total effective dose from medical diagnostic examinations is estimated to have increased approximately 70% [2]. The radiation protection is, therefore, becoming increasingly important to ensure radiation safety of the patients. PNRA “Regulations on Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)\" establish dose levels for diagnostic and interventional radiology. These guidance levels serve as baseline for the development of protocols for minimization of patient doses subject to diagnostic procedures. Dose reduction requires careful attention to equipment specifications. Any modifications in operational factors may result in variation of dose to patient(s). All attempts should be made to conform to good radiation practices and to minimize doses to individual patient.\\n\\n2 OBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance to the licensees of medical facilities and describe different ways through which doses can be reduced without compromising the diagnostic information.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThis regulatory guide applies to individuals, practices or facilities where diagnostic or\\n\\ninterventional diagnostic examinations are performed.\\n\\n4\\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF RADIATION PROTECTION AND PATIENT SAFETY\\n\\n4.1. Justification\\n\\nMedical exposures should be justified by weighing the diagnostic benefits they produce against the radiation detriment they might cause, taking into account the benefits and risks of available alternative techniques such as Ultrasonography (USG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), etc.\\n\\n4.2. Optimization\\n\\nThe optimization of radiation protection and safety, when applied to the exposure of workers and members of the public, attendants and comforters of patients undergoing radiological procedures, is a process of ensuring that likelihood and magnitude of exposures and the number of individuals exposed are As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), with economic, societal and environmental factors taken into account.\\n\\nIn diagnostic radiology, the required clinical information for diagnosis can be obtained\\n\\n1\\n\\nwith minimum exposure of patients by taking into account:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nThe relevant information from previous examinations in order to avoid unnecessary additional examinations; Proper selection of equipment and procedures; Qualification and continuous training of workers; Effective quality assurance program; The relevant guidance levels for medical exposure; Assessment/audits of practices for continuous improvement.\\n\\nŸ\\n\\n5\\n\\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF MEDICAL/HEALTH PROFESSIONALS\\n\\nAs per Regulation 35(1)(b) of “Regulations on Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)\", \"The licensee shall ensure that medical professionals are assigned the primary task and obligation of ensuring overall patient protection and safety in the prescription of, and during the delivery of, medical exposure\" [3]. The first step in reduction of patient doses is the availability of a qualified Radiologist, Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO) and Radiographer.\\n\\nResponsibilities of medical/health professionals regarding protection of patients in\\n\\ndiagnostic radiology are given below:\\n\\n5.1. Responsibilities of Radiologist\\n\\nThe radiologist should ensure that:\\n\\ni. Overall radiation protection of the patient is achieved; ii.\\n\\nExposure of the patient is kept to the minimum required to achieve the intended objective, taking into account the relevant guidance levels for medical exposure;\\n\\niii. Optimized protocols for diagnostic procedures are established; iv. Guidance is being provided for examination of the pregnant women, pediatric\\n\\npatients, medico-legal procedures, and occupational health examinations;\\n\\nv. Any radiation incident or accident is evaluated and investigated from medical point\\n\\nof view;\\n\\nvi. Qualification and training needs of radiation workers including Medical\\n\\nPhysicist/RPO and Radiographers are established;\\n\\nvii. Appropriate training and retraining of radiation workers (i.e. Medical Physicist/RPO\\n\\nand Radiographers) is arranged periodically.\\n\\n5.2. Responsibilities of Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO)\\n\\nThe Medical Physicist/RPO is responsible for technical and administrative matters\\n\\nrelated to radiation protection at the facility. The Medical Physicist/RPO should ensure:\\n\\ni. Overall radiation protection of patients at the facility;\\n\\n2\\n\\nii. Development of Radiation Protection and Quality Assurance (QA) Program and\\n\\niii.\\n\\nrelevant procedures; Implementation of regulatory requirements, Radiation Protection and QA Program and applicable procedures;\\n\\niv. Supervision/conduct of Quality Control (QC) test of X-ray machine(s) and other\\n\\nequipment/accessories; v. Training of workers on radiation safety and radiological protection of patients; vi. Maintenance of records relevant to QC of equipment and radiation protection.\\n\\n5.3. Responsibilities of Radiographer/Operator\\n\\nThe main responsibility of the radiographer/operator is to:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nComply with the facility operating procedures; Identify the patient correctly by:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nName; Gender; ID/ CNIC/ Passport Number; and Date of birth, address and any unique patient number.\\n\\niii. Verify that the female patient is not pregnant; iv. Brief the patient(s) about the procedure, correct positioning and immobilization\\n\\nduring exposure;\\n\\nv. Use appropriate shielding for patient such as lead apron, gonad shield etc.; vi. Perform QC tests under the supervision of Medical Physicist.\\n\\nAdditionally, operators should:\\n\\ni. ii. Routinely review their work practices to optimize operational protocols.\\n\\nBe well aware of any dose reduction techniques specific to the equipment;\\n\\n6\\n\\nFACTORS AFFECTING DOSES IN X-RAY IMAGING PROCEDURES\\n\\nFactors affecting patient doses in all X-ray imaging procedures include beam energy, filtration, collimation, patient size, image processing and expertise of relevant staff. In conventional radiography, one of the important determinants of acceptable patient dose is the use of accurate peak kilo-voltage (kVp). Digital radiography allows much wider range of exposures than conventional radiography for producing diagnostic images. However, operators must be aware of subtle differences in techniques used with digital systems to avoid unnecessary exposure to patients. Mammography requires lower ranges of kVp; different target materials, filters, and screen-film combinations; special attention to breast thickness, composition and compression during the study; and different standards for grids, magnification and optical density. Although, kVp and tube current are important for controlling patient doses in fluoroscopy, however, collimation, source-to-skin and patient-to- image intensifier distances and control of beam-on time also play an important role. Computed\\n\\n3\\n\\nTomography (CT) involves greater patient doses than conventional radiography. Although, primary radiation dose is delivered to smaller volumes, however, dose calculations in CT must account for dose received by the adjacent tissue section(s) as well.\\n\\n6.1. Radiography\\n\\nRadiography refers to create a planar image using X-rays. In radiography, Entrance Surface Dose (ESD) is very important factor which is proportional to the tube current, the length of exposure and the square of kVp. Another factor is inverse square law which states that when all other factors are held constant, the dose at any location is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.\\n\\n6.1.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional Radiography.\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Filtration: Beam energy primarily depends on kVp selected and the amount of filtration in the beam. Selection of higher kVp increases beam penetrability. In practice, this may allow for use of a lower tube current or a shorter exposure, thereby reducing dose to the patient. It is advisable to use a total filtration (which includes the tube wall and any other added filtration) of at least 2.5 mm of Aluminum equivalent, if machines are operated at tube potentials above 70 kVp. This filtration preferentially absorbs the low energy X-rays in the beam. Without filtration, this low energy radiation may completely be absorbed in the patient\\'s body, thereby contributing to patient dose without contributing to the image. However, added filtration increases the average energy of X-ray beam which results in better image quality. Collimation: During any diagnostic procedure, the area of patient\\'s body exposed should be limited to the area of clinical interest. By using collimation, unnecessary patient exposure can be substantially reduced. It has an added effect by reducing the area of X-ray beam and the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor thereby increasing the contrast of the final images.\\n\\niii. Grid: Grid is used in radiography to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor, and to improve the image contrast. It, at the same time, results in higher patient dose. High quality images, obtained by using grid, may result in fewer retakes, however, more accurate diagnosis. Patient Size: With the increase in thickness of the imaging area, kVp should also be increased to obtain required results. Although no control can be exercised over the patient size, however, it is beneficial to know the types of exposures expected for examinations of different anatomical areas and patients of different sizes. Technique charts, that display different radiographic technique factors for various examinations, displayed near the operator\\'s console may be helpful in this regard. Screen-Film Combinations: Use of a faster screen-film combination can substantially reduce dose. Faster systems may result in some loss of details.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\n4\\n\\n6.1.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Digital Radiography\\n\\nDigital Radiography (DR) is the process in which X-ray image is captured through a digital image capture device, saved for future record and is made available for interpretation or further assessment. The advantages of DR over film include; immediate image preview and availability, a wider dynamic range which makes it more forgiving for over and under exposure as well as the ability to apply special image processing techniques that enhance overall display of the image. The largest motivator for healthcare facilities to adopt DR is its potential to reduce costs associated with processing, managing and storing films.\\n\\nIn digital radiography, there is a trade-off between image quality, noise, and patient dose. Efforts to reduce radiation doses during imaging studies have been traditionally limited by a lower image quality, but the use of digital modalities may offer an opportunity to reduce exposure with images of adequate quality. Many approaches are available to acquire better image quality with minimum possible exposures. One way is to increase kVp with corresponding decrease in milliampere-seconds (mAs) product. This technique increases beam penetration thereby providing adequate exposure to image receptors while reducing relative absorption in patient and therefore, reducing patient dose.\\n\\n6.2 Mammography\\n\\nMammography is an X-ray examination of the breast. It is the most reliable method of detecting breast cancer. Its principal purpose is to facilitate the detection of breast cancer at a point earlier in its natural history than is possible by clinical examination. The factors that affect diagnostic radiography also apply to mammography. However, it involves different parameters because of different nature of the tissue being imaged. Generally, the term “Average Glandular Dose\" (AGD) is used to describe the dose to a breast tissue in mammography.\\n\\n6.2.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Mammography\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy: The mammographic range of peak kVp is much lower than that used for all other applications of radiography because high contrast is required to image the soft breast tissues. Small differences in beam energy in mammography greatly affect the resulting dose to the patient. Target Material: Different target materials yield X-rays of different energies, therefore, patient dose is affected when different target materials are used. Molybdenum which emits characteristic X-rays of approximately 18 and 20 kV is used as a target material. Recently, Rhodium which emits characteristic X-rays of approximately 23 kV is being used for imaging thick or dense breasts. Tungsten has also been used as a target material. It is useful while imaging thick and dense breast tissues.\\n\\niii. Filter Material: Filters are used to shape the X-ray energy spectrum. Filters absorb\\n\\n5\\n\\nlow energy X-rays that do not contribute to image formation and high energy X-rays that would degrade image contrast. In mammography, imaging is performed at the characteristic energy of the target material. Therefore, to avail characteristic energy peak of the target material, same material is used as a filter. For example, Molybdenum and Rhodium are used as filter materials along with Molybdenum and Rhodium targets respectively. Molybdenum selectively filters out a high percentage of X-rays with energies more than 20 kV and Rhodium X-rays with energies more than 23 kV. Rhodium filters result in more penetrating X-ray beam and can provide a substantial dose reduction when imaging thick, dense breast tissues.\\n\\niv. Grid: In mammography, grid is used to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor. The bucky factor for mammography grid is usually in the range of 2-3.\\n\\nv. Magnification: Magnification can be an excellent tool for imaging very small breast lesions but it also increases the AGD. Magnification is achieved by moving the breast further away from the image receptor and closer to the X-ray tube. The increase in the distance of breast from the image receptor and the fact that grid is removed during magnification results in increased AGD.\\n\\nvi. Breast Thickness and Tissue Composition: Thickness and composition of breast tissues have substantial impact on patient dose. High energy X-ray beam and longer exposure time are required to obtain acceptable images in case of thick and dense breast tissue and hence results in high AGD.\\n\\nvii. Compression: Compression of the breast tissue results in a lower AGD as the\\n\\nthickness is reduced. It also results in more uniform exposure to the breast.\\n\\nviii. Image Optical Density: Optical Density (OD) refers to the darkness, or density of the exposed film. If greater optical density is required, more exposure will be needed. Increasing the optical density of films results in higher AGD to patients. Screen-Film Combinations: Screen-film combinations of various speeds can also be used in mammography. As in mammograms, greater detail is required, therefore, a slower screen-film combination is used which results in a higher AGD.\\n\\nix.\\n\\n6.3 Fluoroscopy\\n\\nFluoroscopy is used to obtain real-time images for diagnostic purposes and to get\\n\\nguidance for other medical procedures.\\n\\n6.3.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Fluoroscopy\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Tube Current: Beam energy (kVp) as well as tube current (mA) plays an important role in patient dose. Higher kVp and lower tube current results in more penetrating beam. Increasing tube current results in increasing the number of photons which ultimately yield to increasing patient dose. Maintaining the highest kVp that will produce acceptable image contrast leads to lower patient dose. Collimation: In fluoroscopy collimators are important in considerations of the patient\\n\\n6\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\ndose. Extended “beam-on” time may be used in fluoroscopy which may result in substantially higher doses to the areas surrounding the area of clinical interest. This potential overexposure can easily be avoided by using small field size required to image the area of interest only. Proper collimation also reduces the contribution of scattered radiation and leads to higher quality images. Source-to-Skin Distance: The dose rate of a fluoroscopic X-ray beam as it exits the X- ray tube is extremely high. Increasing the source-to-skin distance decreases the dose to patient. Maintaining the maximum possible distance between X-ray source and the patient body is the most effective means of reducing patient dose. Patient-to-Image Intensifier Distance: Distance between the patient and the image intensifier also has substantial effect on patient dose. By decreasing the distance, the dose rate of the X-ray beam can be reduced. Decrease in dose rate results in lower cumulative dose to the patient. However, minimizing this distance also means that a large fraction of scattered radiation will contribute to image. It is widely accepted, however, that minimizing patient-to-image intensifier distance is the most preferred method to reduce patient dose. Image Magnification: Image magnification results in higher patient dose. Magnification can be achieved by two means, namely; geometric and electronic. Geometric magnification is obtained by moving the image intensifier further away from the patient, by moving the X-ray source closer to the patient or both. In electronic magnification of the image, the size of X-ray beam may be restricted to impinge on a portion of the image intensifier only. This technique usually produces an increase in patient dose, although to a smaller degree than geometric magnification.\\n\\nvi. Grid: Use of grid in fluoroscopy reduces the amount of scattered radiation and yields images with improved contrast. Patient doses, however, increase by a factor of two or more. In some cases grids may be removed without a substantial loss in image contrast e.g. when the patient is small and when the patient-to-image intensifier distances is sufficiently large.\\n\\nvii. Patient Size: Thick patient or dense areas within patient body cause more X-ray beam to be absorbed or scattered. The backscatter factor also contributes to an increased ESD in thicker patients. Operators should realize that ESD accumulates more rapidly in obese patients making them more susceptible to radiation burns.\\n\\nviii. Beam–On Time: The amount of dose delivered to a patient is directly proportional to the amount of time the X-ray source is energized, creating a real time image. Use of short intermittent exposures rather than extended continuous exposures also reduce patient dose. Keeping beam-on time to a minimum is the most effective way to reduce the patient dose. It is advisable to maintain written records of beam-on times. These records may prove useful if patient doses are to be estimated.\\n\\n6.3.2 Patient Doses in Fluoroscopy\\n\\nThe dose rate to a patient in fluoroscopy is greatest at the skin. The entrance exposure\\n\\n7\\n\\nlimit for standard operation of a fluoroscope is 25 mGy/min for normal and 100 mGy/min for high level operation mode [3].\\n\\nAppropriate protocols should be available at every facility for physicians to minimize doses to the patients in order to avoid deterministic effects (e.g. burns) and occurrence of stochastic effects (e.g. cancer).\\n\\n6.4 Computed Tomography (CT)\\n\\nCT stands for computed tomography. The CT scan can reveal anatomic details of internal organs that cannot be seen in conventional X-rays. The X-ray tube spins rapidly around the patient and the X-rays strike numerous detectors after passing through the body. These detectors are connected to sophisticated computers which generate images after image processing. The radiation dose of a CT scanner is much higher than a conventional X-ray, but the information obtained from a CT scan is often much greater.\\n\\nTwo most commonly reported doses for CT are those delivered during head and body scans. Currently, in latest equipment available in the market, CT Dose Index (CTDI) values are usually provided by the manufacturers.\\n\\nGenerally, in CT scan, Multi Scan Average Dose (MSAD) ranges from 40 – 60 mGy (4-6 rad) for head scans and from 10 – 40 mGy (1-4 rad) for body scans. Whereas, a scout scan usually results in a surface dose of approximately 1 mGy (100 mrad) [4].\\n\\n6.4.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional CT\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Filtration: Radiation dose in diagnostic radiology mainly depends on beam energy; the higher the beam energy for an exposure, the higher will be the patient dose. Use of most appropriate kVp for a given examination is important to keep patient doses minimum. The type of filter placed in the X-ray beam also plays an important role in resulting beam energy in CT. These filters may be shaped to present different thicknesses at different points across the X-ray beam. The type of filter used for a specific CT examination is usually determined by the manufacturer and can reduce the ratio of surface dose to midline dose. Collimation: Collimation of X-ray beam plays a significant role in patient doses in CT. Effective utilization of pre-patient collimators confine the beam to section thickness intended at the area of interest and keep the doses minimum to the adjacent tissues. Another set of collimators may be positioned post-patient or pre-detector to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the detector. Images with better contrast and resolution are obtained through this technique which may affect patient dose indirectly.\\n\\niii. Number and Spacing of Adjacent Sections: Patient dose in CT is also affected by the number and spacing of adjacent sections. When more sections are scanned, more volume of tissue is irradiated. The MSAD may increase because of the penumbra\\n\\n8\\n\\niv.\\n\\nresulting from scattered radiation and possible beam divergence. With the increase in ratio between section thickness and section interval, the MSAD also increases because of increasing contributions from neighboring sections. Image Quality and Noise: Statistical noise and loss of image contrast as a result of scattered radiation are most important factors affecting image quality. The dose used to acquire the image increases with the decrease in noise. To maintain acceptable levels of noise, the kVp and tube current used to acquire the image may need to be increased.\\n\\n6.4.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Spiral CT\\n\\nIn spiral CT, continuous scanning of patient while the couch is moving through the scanner is possible. A large volume of the tissue can be scanned in a relatively short time in spiral CT. All the variables of traditional CT also apply to spiral CT, however, scan pitch is an additional important factor that must be considered in spiral CT.\\n\\nPitch is a ratio of distance that patient\\'s couch travels during 360º gantry rotation to the section thickness. If the couch travels 10 mm during one rotation and the section thickness is 10 mm, the pitch would be 1 (one). The larger the pitch, more tissue can be imaged during the same scan interval.\\n\\nFor a spiral CT examination with a pitch of 1 (one), the dose to patient should be comparable with the dose delivered in a traditional CT of the same volume of the tissue. Patient dose is inversely proportional to pitch, as the pitch is increased, the dose at any point along the volume of tissue decreases and vice versa.\\n\\n6.5 Dental Radiology\\n\\nDental radiography is the process of taking the X-ray images (pictures) of a teeth, bones, and soft tissues around them to help find problems with the teeth. It is one of the most frequent type of radiology procedures performed. Although, exposure associated with dental radiology is relatively low, however, radiological procedure should be justified and optimized to keep the radiation risk as low as reasonably possible. In dental radiology, ESD without backscatter for intraoral examinations and the Dose Width Product (DWP) for panoramic examinations is recommended for the setting of Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) [5].\\n\\n6.5.1 Factors Contributing Dose Variation\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nCollimation, Field- Size Trimming: Rectangular collimation which approximates the size and shape of the receptor reduces the dose significantly in comparison with circular collimation. A dose reduction exceeding 60% can be achieved in dental radiology by using rectangular collimation. Choice of Image Receptor: Digital detectors have the potential for further dose reduction, even compared with F-speed film, provided the repeat rate and use of\\n\\n9\\n\\nhigher exposure factors than necessary are controlled. The fastest available film consistent with achieving satisfactory diagnostic results should be used. E-speed and F-speed films reduce doses more than 50% compared with D-speed films.\\n\\niii. X-ray Generation and Kilo-voltage: For dental radiology, 65-70 kV is recommended as kilo-voltage of choice in intraoral X-ray sets using AC equipment, with 60 kV for those using DC X-ray sets.\\n\\niv. Filtration: X-ray tube filtration should be sufficient to reduce entrance surface dose to the patient consistent with producing satisfactory image quality. Filtration by aluminum is a key method of reducing skin dose to patients. Position Indication Device: A position indication device which ensures minimum focus-to-skin distance of 20 cm should be attached to the tube head (e.g. by use of a long collimator/cone as compared to a short conical one).\\n\\nv.\\n\\n6.6\\n\\nIn Utero Exposure in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\nPNRA Regulations on Radiation Protection (PAK/904), requires medical practitioners to avoid exposure to abdomen or pelvis of women patients who are or likely to be pregnant. If the exposure to any other body part or even to the abdomen/pelvis is justified, the medical practitioner is required to plan and conduct the exposure appropriately.\\n\\n6.6.1 Factors Affecting Fetal Dose in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nDirect (inside field of view) Exposure: If a fetus is located within the field of view of a particular examination, such as studies of the abdomen, pelvis and lumbar spine, it is exposed directly to primary beam radiation. This situation typically results in the highest fetal doses. Shielding in such situations becomes ineffective because it cannot cover the area being imaged. Indirect (outside field of view) Exposure: In case of examinations of skull and extremities, bulk of the exposure received by a fetus is from indirect scattered radiation from maternal tissues. The dose received in this situation is lower than the direct exposure. Shielding in this situation is again of limited value as most of the fetal dose results from internal scatter in the mother.\\n\\n6.6.2 Fetal Dose Estimation in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\nFetal doses are estimated using the following imaging techniques:\\n\\ni. Output intensity (measured in exposure or air kerma) of the X-ray equipment for diagnostic exposures, entrance exposure (or air kerma rate) and fluoroscopic exposures, along with the conditions of the examination should be known; The Half-Value Layer (HVL) should be used to determine beam penetrability; Information about the conditions of procedure should include the location, number of images taken and radiographic exposure factors; For fluoroscopic procedures, the beam-on time and number of digital or cassette spot images taken should also be known;\\n\\nii. iii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\n10\\n\\nv.\\n\\nPatient information should include fetal age at the time of exposure, patient\\'s size and thickness, depth of fetus, and orientation of patient.\\n\\nAccording to the data published in the Article of Radiographics [4], estimated doses to\\n\\nuterus from typical diagnostic procedures are listed in the Table-1.\\n\\nTable-1 : Estimated Doses to the Uterus from Typical Diagnostic Procedures\\n\\nEXAMINATION\\n\\nABSORBED DOSE mGy mrad\\n\\nUpper Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) Series\\n\\n1\\n\\n100\\n\\nCholecystography\\n\\n1\\n\\n100\\n\\nLumbar Spine Radiography\\n\\n4\\n\\n400\\n\\nPelvic Radiography\\n\\n2\\n\\n200\\n\\nHip and Femur Radiography\\n\\n3\\n\\n300\\n\\nRetrograde Pyelography\\n\\n6\\n\\n600\\n\\nBarium Enema Study\\n\\n10\\n\\n1000\\n\\nAbdominal Radiography (KUB)\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n250\\n\\nHysterosalpingography (HSG)\\n\\n10\\n\\n1000\\n\\nCT Ÿ Head Ÿ Chest Ÿ Abdomen\\n\\nApprox 0 0.16 30\\n\\nApprox 0 16 3000\\n\\nThe medical/health professionals at a diagnostic radiology facility should be aware of the effect of the factors/technical parameters such as KVp, mAs, collimation etc. on dose and image quality and they should select appropriate parameters, as relevant, such that their combination produce the minimum patient exposure consistent with the acceptable image quality and clinical purpose of the examination.\\n\\n6.7 Film Processing\\n\\nPatients may undergo repeated X-ray examinations after their initial X-ray radiographs are rejected due to poor image quality. Good quality of radiographs cannot be acquired without proper film processing.\\n\\nIn manual processing, technical factors, such as developer temperature, developing time and chemistry replenishment, affect the quality of the films and are much more difficult to control. The darkrooms, in manual processing, should be equipped with a timer and\\n\\n11\\n\\nthermometer, and a time-temperature development table which should be followed for processing all the films.\\n\\nAutomatic film processing is preferred because of less processing time. The film processor should be used according to the manufacturer\\'s recommendations. If temperature, transport rate or replenishment rates differ substantially from the recommended values, the effects on the image quality can be significant which may lead to modification of radiographic techniques that in turn directly affect patient\\'s dose.\\n\\nFilm processing conditions are also important in mammography. Manufacturer\\'s recommendations for processing should be strictly followed. Deviations can lead to use of improper exposure techniques thereby increasing the patient dose. Another consideration is the length of film-processing cycle which can be either standard or extended. Extended cycle and processing allows a decrease in dose required to produce acceptable images. However, not all mammography films are compatible with extended-cycle processing.\\n\\n7 MANAGING PATIENT DOSES\\n\\nThe factors affecting the management of patient doses are described in the following\\n\\nsections:\\n\\n7.1 Developments in Equipments and Accessories\\n\\nTechnical development that made most significant contribution to patient dose reduction is the intensifying screen. From direct film radiography to modern rare earth phosphors (typically Oxysulphides or Oxybromides of Gadolinium and Lanthanum), dose reduction of a factor of 15-500 have been made possible, depending upon the type of screen and film used. Rare earth screens have three to five times better dose efficiency as compared to Calcium Tungstate screens which are still in common use [7]. Spectral sensitivity of a film should match the emission spectrum of the intensifying screen used. Any mismatch will have financial implications and it may lead to increased radiation doses to the patients. There is thus an immediate scope for dose reduction by switching over to rare earth screens.\\n\\nEquipment with unsatisfactory safety and quality features should not be operated. Type approval of X-ray machines and registration may serve as an efficient method of ensuring conformity to specifications. New X-ray equipments may have malfunctions in one or more of their radiological parameters including; kVp, timing, beam congruence or centering and milli- ampere second linearity of some of their mechanical parameters which can be detected by acceptance testing. A qualified person, preferably a radiology medical physicist, may use these tests to verify that the initial performance of the equipment conforms to the manufacturer\\'s specifications and international standards [8,9]. The person testing the equipment should thoroughly document the results of acceptance tests as those results might be used in part to define the acceptable range of parameters that will be monitored in any subsequent test. If no acceptance testing is carried out, there are 80% chances of starting with a\\n\\n12\\n\\npoorly functioning unit.\\n\\nAfter successful installation and acceptance of equipment, QC testing of the equipment must be carried out on an ongoing basis for continued and reliable performance. A medical physicist should perform QC testing of the equipment at a defined frequency to look for changes that may cause degradation of image quality or an increase in radiation exposure to patient.\\n\\nMoreover, maintenance policy should be established for the maintenance of older equipment to avoid unnecessary exposures. Replacing/changing some of the accessories may also result in a patient dose reduction. Considerable attention should be given to introduction of Carbon fibers in table tops. Typically the dose can be reduced by 3-15% by changing the table top, 6-12% by changing the front of film cassette and 20-30% by using a grid with carbon fiber covers and fiber interspaces [10].\\n\\n7.2 Referrals\\n\\nRadiological examination is advised by the physicians to establish a diagnosis, however, not all the diagnostic examinations are clinically helpful. Expertise of physician, referring diagnostic examination, can help in saving the potential collective dose. Evidence based medicine has become an accepted practice, along with evidence based radiology.\\n\\nThe referring physician bears special responsibility and should use guidelines for diagnosis to a greater extent. The referring physician should take into account all clinical aspects regarding management of every patient individually/separately. In difficult cases, they should also consult with their colleagues in radiology in the selection of the most suitable procedure. Other possible procedures with lower or no exposure, such as USG or MRI, should be considered, if and when appropriate, before proceeding to radiological procedures.\\n\\n7.3 Education and Training\\n\\nThe personnel involved in advice and delivery of any radiology examination should be qualified and receive adequate training. The role played by training and education must be emphasized when it comes to the dose reductions possible in the hands of operators, developing expertise to advice manufacturers, making the right choice of equipment at the time of purchase and spreading a culture of radiation protection among the personnel. A substantial dose reduction (nearly 40%) can be achieved by training of the staff. This is the responsibility of the licensee to plan and execute effective training and re-training programs for its workers.\\n\\n7.4 Dose Guidance Levels\\n\\nPatient doses in diagnostic examinations are controlled by restricting dose up to a certain level, specific for an examination, suggesting that the dose is sufficient to create better quality\\n\\n13\\n\\nimage of human anatomy. Dose guidance levels have been replaced by dose reference levels in recent recommendations of ICRP on radiation protection [11]. The dose guidance levels for conventional radiography, computed tomography and mammography are given in Table-2, Table-3 and Table-4 respectively [3].\\n\\nTable-2 : Dose Guidance Levels for Conventional Radiography\\n\\nExamination\\n\\nEntrance Surface Dose per Radiograph* (mGy)\\n\\nLumbar Spine\\n\\nAP LAT\\n\\n10 30\\n\\nAbdomen, Intravenous Urology and Cholecystography\\n\\nLSJ AP\\n\\n40 10\\n\\nPelvis\\n\\nAP\\n\\n10\\n\\nHip joint\\n\\nAP\\n\\n10\\n\\nChest\\n\\nPA LAT\\n\\n0.4 1.5\\n\\nDental\\n\\nLAT Periapical AP PA\\n\\n20 07 05 05\\n\\nSkull\\n\\nLAT\\n\\n03\\n\\nNotes: PA: posterior-anterior projection; LAT: lateral projection; LSJ: lumbo-sacral-joint projection;\\n\\nAP: anterior-posterior projection.\\n\\nIn air with backscatter, these values are for conventional film-screen combination in the relative speed of 200. For high speed film-screen combinations (400- 600), the values should be reduced by a factor of 2 to 3.\\n\\nTable-3: Dose Guidance Levels for Computed Tomography\\n\\nExamination\\n\\nMultiple Scan Average Dose* (mGy)\\n\\nHead\\n\\n50\\n\\nLumbar Spine\\n\\n35\\n\\nAbdomen\\n\\n25\\n\\nDerived from measurements on the axis of rotation in water equivalent phantoms, 15 cm in length and 16 cm (head) and 30 cm (lumbar spine and abdomen) in diameter.\\n\\n14\\n\\nTable-4: Dose Guidance Levels for Mammography\\n\\nAverage Glandular dose (mGy) per Cranio-Caudal Projection*\\n\\n1 (without grid) 3 (with grid)\\n\\nDetermined in a 4.5 cm compressed breast consisting of 50 % glandular and 50 % adipose tissue, for film-screen systems and dedicated Mo-target Mo-filter mammography units.\\n\\nDose guidance levels have been established through worldwide survey practices. With the improvement of imaging technology, the radiation doses in an examination can be significantly reduced with good image quality. Furthermore, better performance and selection of proper technique in the same examination for different human beings further reduce the population dose. Many countries all over the world perform periodic surveys to assess the patient doses in diagnostic examinations. On the basis of the results thus obtained, the guidance levels are revised to lower doses.\\n\\n7.5 Clinical Dosimetry in Radiology\\n\\nRadiation protection of patients undergoing medical X-ray examinations is governed by the principles of justification and optimization. Radiation dosimetry is required to inform medical practitioners of the levels of exposure and hence the risks associated with the diagnostic procedures that they have to justify and to assist the operators of X-ray imaging equipment to determine whether their procedures are optimized. The dosimetric quantities to be considered during diagnostic work are:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nESD for individual radiographs; Dose-Area Product (DAP) for individual radiographs; DAP for complete examinations involving radiography and/or fluoroscopy; Weighted CT Dose Index (CTDIw) per slice in spiral CT scanning or per rotation in helical CT scanning; Dose-Length Product (DLP) per complete CT examination.\\n\\n7.5.1 Entrance Surface Dose\\n\\nIt is the entrance air Kerma with backscatter from patient skin. It is usually expressed in milligray (mGy) and can be measured directly with suitably calibrated TLDs attached to the patient\\'s skin or with ionization chambers supported in free air on the X-ray beam axis, corrected to the Focus Skin Distance (FSD) and by a suitable backscatter factor. It is the quantity of more concern for practical patient dosimetry. Specific X-ray tube output measurements, as a function of tube voltage (kV) and charge (mAs) made during routine quality assurance programs, are frequently used to calculate ESD values from the exposure parameters (kV, mAs, FSD) used for radiographs on a particular patient [12].\\n\\n15\\n\\n7.5.2 Dose Area Product\\n\\nIt is the absorbed dose to air (or the air kerma) averaged over the area of X-ray beam in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis, multiplied by the area of beam (A) in the same plane. It is usually expressed in Gy-cm2 and being invariant with distance from X-ray tube focus, it is conveniently measured with special large area ionization chambers (DAP meters) attached to the diaphragm housing of the X-ray tube, which intercept the entire cross section of the beam. They essentially integrate the absorbed dose over whole beam area for any number of diagnostic or fluoroscopic exposures and can thus provide a single measurement of total amount of radiation used in a complete X-ray examination involving radiography and fluoroscopy. DAP meters should be calibrated after installation on an X-ray set to take account of the particular scatter conditions and attenuating material between the DAP meter and the patient (e.g. the table top for under-couch X-ray tubes) [12].\\n\\n7.5.3 CT Dose Index\\n\\nThe principal dosimetric quantity used in CT is the CTDI. This is defined as the integral along a line parallel to the axis of rotation (z) of the dose profile [D(z)] for a single rotation and a fixed table position, divided by the nominal thickness of the X-ray beam. CTDI can be conveniently assessed using a pencil ionization chamber with an active length of 100 mm, so as to provide a measurement of CTDI100, expressed in terms of absorbed dose to air (mGy) [13].\\n\\nWhere \"n\" is the number of tomographic slices, each of nominal thickness \"T\", imaged\\n\\nduring a single rotation.\\n\\n7.6 Assessment of Exposure to the Patient at Individual X-ray Facilities\\n\\nPatient exposure assessment should always be associated with monitoring image information. Patient exposure and image quality assessments at individual facilities should be carried out on a sample of typical patients.\\n\\nAssessment of patient doses serve the following purposes:\\n\\ni. ii. Comparing doses and dose distributions for the same type of examination, done with different exposure parameters or with different equipment, or in different X-ray rooms or different hospitals or different countries, or to monitor improvement by making comparisons before and after changes;\\n\\nEstablishing guidance levels (reference levels);\\n\\niii. Comparing patient exposure for different types of examinations. Effective dose is, therefore, used for comparison; however, the caution of using effective doses for patients as indicated in UNSCEAR should be kept in mind;\\n\\niv. Assessing relative contributions to collective doses from various types of examinations or even comparing medical with non-medical radiation exposure of\\n\\n16\\n\\n8\\n\\nthe population;\\n\\nv. Analyzing trends in the use of radiation e.g. change in frequency and dose per examination, introduction of new examination techniques or modification of techniques; and\\n\\nvi. Comparison of patient doses with guidance levels to get an idea if doses are on the\\n\\nhigh side.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIAEA, \"Radiation Doses in Diagnostic Radiology and Methods for Dose Reduction\", TECDOC-796, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna (1995)\\n\\n2.

Since, radiology is an important tool for diagnosis, therefore, diagnostic procedures have become routine part of clinical life and the number of such procedures is ever increasing. Keeping in view the diversity of patients and nature of their examinations, dose limits are not applicable in diagnostic procedures. In fact, the guidance levels are established for radiological procedure so that required clinical information for diagnosis may be obtained at a reasonable amount of radiation dose; which is the ultimate goal of “optimization in patient doses”.\\n\\nThe patient doses are affected by a number of parameters such as equipments, techniques and expertise. This regulatory guide addresses the appropriateness of operating parameters such as mAs, kVp and; equipments including grid, collimator and image receptors; techniques like general radiography, mammography and fluoroscopy; and knowledge/skills of operating personnel. In addition to this, various administrative issues such as responsibilities and training of workers have also been addressed in this regulatory guide.\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................1 OBJECTIVE ...............................................................................................................1 SCOPE ...............................................................................................................1 PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION PROTECTION AND PATIENT SAFETY .........1 Justification ........................................................................................................1 4.1. 4.2.

According to United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), there are over 3.6 billion medical radiation imaging procedures carried out annually. According to survey conducted by UNSCEAR for the period from 1997-2007, total effective dose from medical diagnostic examinations is estimated to have increased approximately 70% [2]. The radiation protection is, therefore, becoming increasingly important to ensure radiation safety of the patients. PNRA “Regulations on Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)\" establish dose levels for diagnostic and interventional radiology. These guidance levels serve as baseline for the development of protocols for minimization of patient doses subject to diagnostic procedures. Dose reduction requires careful attention to equipment specifications. Any modifications in operational factors may result in variation of dose to patient(s). All attempts should be made to conform to good radiation practices and to minimize doses to individual patient.\\n\\n2 OBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance to the licensees of medical facilities and describe different ways through which doses can be reduced without compromising the diagnostic information.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThis regulatory guide applies to individuals, practices or facilities where diagnostic or\\n\\ninterventional diagnostic examinations are performed.\\n\\n4\\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF RADIATION PROTECTION AND PATIENT SAFETY\\n\\n4.1. Justification\\n\\nMedical exposures should be justified by weighing the diagnostic benefits they produce against the radiation detriment they might cause, taking into account the benefits and risks of available alternative techniques such as Ultrasonography (USG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), etc.\\n\\n4.2. Optimization\\n\\nThe optimization of radiation protection and safety, when applied to the exposure of workers and members of the public, attendants and comforters of patients undergoing radiological procedures, is a process of ensuring that likelihood and magnitude of exposures and the number of individuals exposed are As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), with economic, societal and environmental factors taken into account.\\n\\nIn diagnostic radiology, the required clinical information for diagnosis can be obtained\\n\\n1\\n\\nwith minimum exposure of patients by taking into account:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nThe relevant information from previous examinations in order to avoid unnecessary additional examinations; Proper selection of equipment and procedures; Qualification and continuous training of workers; Effective quality assurance program; The relevant guidance levels for medical exposure; Assessment/audits of practices for continuous improvement.\\n\\nŸ\\n\\n5\\n\\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF MEDICAL/HEALTH PROFESSIONALS\\n\\nAs per Regulation 35(1)(b) of “Regulations on Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)\", \"The licensee shall ensure that medical professionals are assigned the primary task and obligation of ensuring overall patient protection and safety in the prescription of, and during the delivery of, medical exposure\" [3]. The first step in reduction of patient doses is the availability of a qualified Radiologist, Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO) and Radiographer.\\n\\nResponsibilities of medical/health professionals regarding protection of patients in\\n\\ndiagnostic radiology are given below:\\n\\n5.1. Responsibilities of Radiologist\\n\\nThe radiologist should ensure that:\\n\\ni. Overall radiation protection of the patient is achieved; ii.\\n\\nExposure of the patient is kept to the minimum required to achieve the intended objective, taking into account the relevant guidance levels for medical exposure;\\n\\niii. Optimized protocols for diagnostic procedures are established; iv. Guidance is being provided for examination of the pregnant women, pediatric\\n\\npatients, medico-legal procedures, and occupational health examinations;\\n\\nv. Any radiation incident or accident is evaluated and investigated from medical point\\n\\nof view;\\n\\nvi. Qualification and training needs of radiation workers including Medical\\n\\nPhysicist/RPO and Radiographers are established;\\n\\nvii. Appropriate training and retraining of radiation workers (i.e. Medical Physicist/RPO\\n\\nand Radiographers) is arranged periodically.\\n\\n5.2. Responsibilities of Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO)\\n\\nThe Medical Physicist/RPO is responsible for technical and administrative matters\\n\\nrelated to radiation protection at the facility. The Medical Physicist/RPO should ensure:\\n\\ni. Overall radiation protection of patients at the facility;\\n\\n2\\n\\nii. Development of Radiation Protection and Quality Assurance (QA) Program and\\n\\niii.\\n\\nrelevant procedures; Implementation of regulatory requirements, Radiation Protection and QA Program and applicable procedures;\\n\\niv. Supervision/conduct of Quality Control (QC) test of X-ray machine(s) and other\\n\\nequipment/accessories; v. Training of workers on radiation safety and radiological protection of patients; vi. Maintenance of records relevant to QC of equipment and radiation protection.\\n\\n5.3. Responsibilities of Radiographer/Operator\\n\\nThe main responsibility of the radiographer/operator is to:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nComply with the facility operating procedures; Identify the patient correctly by:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nName; Gender; ID/ CNIC/ Passport Number; and Date of birth, address and any unique patient number.\\n\\niii. Verify that the female patient is not pregnant; iv. Brief the patient(s) about the procedure, correct positioning and immobilization\\n\\nduring exposure;\\n\\nv. Use appropriate shielding for patient such as lead apron, gonad shield etc.; vi. Perform QC tests under the supervision of Medical Physicist.\\n\\nAdditionally, operators should:\\n\\ni. ii. Routinely review their work practices to optimize operational protocols.\\n\\nBe well aware of any dose reduction techniques specific to the equipment;\\n\\n6\\n\\nFACTORS AFFECTING DOSES IN X-RAY IMAGING PROCEDURES\\n\\nFactors affecting patient doses in all X-ray imaging procedures include beam energy, filtration, collimation, patient size, image processing and expertise of relevant staff. In conventional radiography, one of the important determinants of acceptable patient dose is the use of accurate peak kilo-voltage (kVp). Digital radiography allows much wider range of exposures than conventional radiography for producing diagnostic images. However, operators must be aware of subtle differences in techniques used with digital systems to avoid unnecessary exposure to patients. Mammography requires lower ranges of kVp; different target materials, filters, and screen-film combinations; special attention to breast thickness, composition and compression during the study; and different standards for grids, magnification and optical density. Although, kVp and tube current are important for controlling patient doses in fluoroscopy, however, collimation, source-to-skin and patient-to- image intensifier distances and control of beam-on time also play an important role. Computed\\n\\n3\\n\\nTomography (CT) involves greater patient doses than conventional radiography. Although, primary radiation dose is delivered to smaller volumes, however, dose calculations in CT must account for dose received by the adjacent tissue section(s) as well.\\n\\n6.1. Radiography\\n\\nRadiography refers to create a planar image using X-rays. In radiography, Entrance Surface Dose (ESD) is very important factor which is proportional to the tube current, the length of exposure and the square of kVp. Another factor is inverse square law which states that when all other factors are held constant, the dose at any location is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.\\n\\n6.1.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional Radiography.\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Filtration: Beam energy primarily depends on kVp selected and the amount of filtration in the beam. Selection of higher kVp increases beam penetrability. In practice, this may allow for use of a lower tube current or a shorter exposure, thereby reducing dose to the patient. It is advisable to use a total filtration (which includes the tube wall and any other added filtration) of at least 2.5 mm of Aluminum equivalent, if machines are operated at tube potentials above 70 kVp. This filtration preferentially absorbs the low energy X-rays in the beam. Without filtration, this low energy radiation may completely be absorbed in the patient\\'s body, thereby contributing to patient dose without contributing to the image. However, added filtration increases the average energy of X-ray beam which results in better image quality. Collimation: During any diagnostic procedure, the area of patient\\'s body exposed should be limited to the area of clinical interest. By using collimation, unnecessary patient exposure can be substantially reduced. It has an added effect by reducing the area of X-ray beam and the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor thereby increasing the contrast of the final images.\\n\\niii. Grid: Grid is used in radiography to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor, and to improve the image contrast. It, at the same time, results in higher patient dose. High quality images, obtained by using grid, may result in fewer retakes, however, more accurate diagnosis. Patient Size: With the increase in thickness of the imaging area, kVp should also be increased to obtain required results. Although no control can be exercised over the patient size, however, it is beneficial to know the types of exposures expected for examinations of different anatomical areas and patients of different sizes. Technique charts, that display different radiographic technique factors for various examinations, displayed near the operator\\'s console may be helpful in this regard. Screen-Film Combinations: Use of a faster screen-film combination can substantially reduce dose. Faster systems may result in some loss of details.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\n4\\n\\n6.1.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Digital Radiography\\n\\nDigital Radiography (DR) is the process in which X-ray image is captured through a digital image capture device, saved for future record and is made available for interpretation or further assessment. The advantages of DR over film include; immediate image preview and availability, a wider dynamic range which makes it more forgiving for over and under exposure as well as the ability to apply special image processing techniques that enhance overall display of the image. The largest motivator for healthcare facilities to adopt DR is its potential to reduce costs associated with processing, managing and storing films.\\n\\nIn digital radiography, there is a trade-off between image quality, noise, and patient dose. Efforts to reduce radiation doses during imaging studies have been traditionally limited by a lower image quality, but the use of digital modalities may offer an opportunity to reduce exposure with images of adequate quality. Many approaches are available to acquire better image quality with minimum possible exposures. One way is to increase kVp with corresponding decrease in milliampere-seconds (mAs) product. This technique increases beam penetration thereby providing adequate exposure to image receptors while reducing relative absorption in patient and therefore, reducing patient dose.\\n\\n6.2 Mammography\\n\\nMammography is an X-ray examination of the breast. It is the most reliable method of detecting breast cancer. Its principal purpose is to facilitate the detection of breast cancer at a point earlier in its natural history than is possible by clinical examination. The factors that affect diagnostic radiography also apply to mammography. However, it involves different parameters because of different nature of the tissue being imaged. Generally, the term “Average Glandular Dose\" (AGD) is used to describe the dose to a breast tissue in mammography.\\n\\n6.2.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Mammography\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy: The mammographic range of peak kVp is much lower than that used for all other applications of radiography because high contrast is required to image the soft breast tissues. Small differences in beam energy in mammography greatly affect the resulting dose to the patient. Target Material: Different target materials yield X-rays of different energies, therefore, patient dose is affected when different target materials are used. Molybdenum which emits characteristic X-rays of approximately 18 and 20 kV is used as a target material. Recently, Rhodium which emits characteristic X-rays of approximately 23 kV is being used for imaging thick or dense breasts. Tungsten has also been used as a target material. It is useful while imaging thick and dense breast tissues.\\n\\niii. Filter Material: Filters are used to shape the X-ray energy spectrum. Filters absorb\\n\\n5\\n\\nlow energy X-rays that do not contribute to image formation and high energy X-rays that would degrade image contrast. In mammography, imaging is performed at the characteristic energy of the target material. Therefore, to avail characteristic energy peak of the target material, same material is used as a filter. For example, Molybdenum and Rhodium are used as filter materials along with Molybdenum and Rhodium targets respectively. Molybdenum selectively filters out a high percentage of X-rays with energies more than 20 kV and Rhodium X-rays with energies more than 23 kV. Rhodium filters result in more penetrating X-ray beam and can provide a substantial dose reduction when imaging thick, dense breast tissues.\\n\\niv. Grid: In mammography, grid is used to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor. The bucky factor for mammography grid is usually in the range of 2-3.\\n\\nv. Magnification: Magnification can be an excellent tool for imaging very small breast lesions but it also increases the AGD. Magnification is achieved by moving the breast further away from the image receptor and closer to the X-ray tube. The increase in the distance of breast from the image receptor and the fact that grid is removed during magnification results in increased AGD.\\n\\nvi. Breast Thickness and Tissue Composition: Thickness and composition of breast tissues have substantial impact on patient dose. High energy X-ray beam and longer exposure time are required to obtain acceptable images in case of thick and dense breast tissue and hence results in high AGD.\\n\\nvii. Compression: Compression of the breast tissue results in a lower AGD as the\\n\\nthickness is reduced. It also results in more uniform exposure to the breast.\\n\\nviii. Image Optical Density: Optical Density (OD) refers to the darkness, or density of the exposed film. If greater optical density is required, more exposure will be needed. Increasing the optical density of films results in higher AGD to patients. Screen-Film Combinations: Screen-film combinations of various speeds can also be used in mammography. As in mammograms, greater detail is required, therefore, a slower screen-film combination is used which results in a higher AGD.\\n\\nix.\\n\\n6.3 Fluoroscopy\\n\\nFluoroscopy is used to obtain real-time images for diagnostic purposes and to get\\n\\nguidance for other medical procedures.\\n\\n6.3.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Fluoroscopy\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Tube Current: Beam energy (kVp) as well as tube current (mA) plays an important role in patient dose. Higher kVp and lower tube current results in more penetrating beam. Increasing tube current results in increasing the number of photons which ultimately yield to increasing patient dose. Maintaining the highest kVp that will produce acceptable image contrast leads to lower patient dose. Collimation: In fluoroscopy collimators are important in considerations of the patient\\n\\n6\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\ndose. Extended “beam-on” time may be used in fluoroscopy which may result in substantially higher doses to the areas surrounding the area of clinical interest. This potential overexposure can easily be avoided by using small field size required to image the area of interest only. Proper collimation also reduces the contribution of scattered radiation and leads to higher quality images. Source-to-Skin Distance: The dose rate of a fluoroscopic X-ray beam as it exits the X- ray tube is extremely high. Increasing the source-to-skin distance decreases the dose to patient. Maintaining the maximum possible distance between X-ray source and the patient body is the most effective means of reducing patient dose. Patient-to-Image Intensifier Distance: Distance between the patient and the image intensifier also has substantial effect on patient dose. By decreasing the distance, the dose rate of the X-ray beam can be reduced. Decrease in dose rate results in lower cumulative dose to the patient. However, minimizing this distance also means that a large fraction of scattered radiation will contribute to image. It is widely accepted, however, that minimizing patient-to-image intensifier distance is the most preferred method to reduce patient dose. Image Magnification: Image magnification results in higher patient dose. Magnification can be achieved by two means, namely; geometric and electronic. Geometric magnification is obtained by moving the image intensifier further away from the patient, by moving the X-ray source closer to the patient or both. In electronic magnification of the image, the size of X-ray beam may be restricted to impinge on a portion of the image intensifier only. This technique usually produces an increase in patient dose, although to a smaller degree than geometric magnification.\\n\\nvi. Grid: Use of grid in fluoroscopy reduces the amount of scattered radiation and yields images with improved contrast. Patient doses, however, increase by a factor of two or more. In some cases grids may be removed without a substantial loss in image contrast e.g. when the patient is small and when the patient-to-image intensifier distances is sufficiently large.\\n\\nvii. Patient Size: Thick patient or dense areas within patient body cause more X-ray beam to be absorbed or scattered. The backscatter factor also contributes to an increased ESD in thicker patients. Operators should realize that ESD accumulates more rapidly in obese patients making them more susceptible to radiation burns.\\n\\nviii. Beam–On Time: The amount of dose delivered to a patient is directly proportional to the amount of time the X-ray source is energized, creating a real time image. Use of short intermittent exposures rather than extended continuous exposures also reduce patient dose. Keeping beam-on time to a minimum is the most effective way to reduce the patient dose. It is advisable to maintain written records of beam-on times. These records may prove useful if patient doses are to be estimated.\\n\\n6.3.2 Patient Doses in Fluoroscopy\\n\\nThe dose rate to a patient in fluoroscopy is greatest at the skin. The entrance exposure\\n\\n7\\n\\nlimit for standard operation of a fluoroscope is 25 mGy/min for normal and 100 mGy/min for high level operation mode [3].\\n\\nAppropriate protocols should be available at every facility for physicians to minimize doses to the patients in order to avoid deterministic effects (e.g. burns) and occurrence of stochastic effects (e.g. cancer).\\n\\n6.4 Computed Tomography (CT)\\n\\nCT stands for computed tomography. The CT scan can reveal anatomic details of internal organs that cannot be seen in conventional X-rays. The X-ray tube spins rapidly around the patient and the X-rays strike numerous detectors after passing through the body. These detectors are connected to sophisticated computers which generate images after image processing. The radiation dose of a CT scanner is much higher than a conventional X-ray, but the information obtained from a CT scan is often much greater.\\n\\nTwo most commonly reported doses for CT are those delivered during head and body scans. Currently, in latest equipment available in the market, CT Dose Index (CTDI) values are usually provided by the manufacturers.\\n\\nGenerally, in CT scan, Multi Scan Average Dose (MSAD) ranges from 40 – 60 mGy (4-6 rad) for head scans and from 10 – 40 mGy (1-4 rad) for body scans. Whereas, a scout scan usually results in a surface dose of approximately 1 mGy (100 mrad) [4].\\n\\n6.4.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional CT\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Filtration: Radiation dose in diagnostic radiology mainly depends on beam energy; the higher the beam energy for an exposure, the higher will be the patient dose. Use of most appropriate kVp for a given examination is important to keep patient doses minimum. The type of filter placed in the X-ray beam also plays an important role in resulting beam energy in CT. These filters may be shaped to present different thicknesses at different points across the X-ray beam. The type of filter used for a specific CT examination is usually determined by the manufacturer and can reduce the ratio of surface dose to midline dose. Collimation: Collimation of X-ray beam plays a significant role in patient doses in CT. Effective utilization of pre-patient collimators confine the beam to section thickness intended at the area of interest and keep the doses minimum to the adjacent tissues. Another set of collimators may be positioned post-patient or pre-detector to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the detector. Images with better contrast and resolution are obtained through this technique which may affect patient dose indirectly.\\n\\niii. Number and Spacing of Adjacent Sections: Patient dose in CT is also affected by the number and spacing of adjacent sections. When more sections are scanned, more volume of tissue is irradiated. The MSAD may increase because of the penumbra\\n\\n8\\n\\niv.\\n\\nresulting from scattered radiation and possible beam divergence. With the increase in ratio between section thickness and section interval, the MSAD also increases because of increasing contributions from neighboring sections. Image Quality and Noise: Statistical noise and loss of image contrast as a result of scattered radiation are most important factors affecting image quality. The dose used to acquire the image increases with the decrease in noise. To maintain acceptable levels of noise, the kVp and tube current used to acquire the image may need to be increased.\\n\\n6.4.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Spiral CT\\n\\nIn spiral CT, continuous scanning of patient while the couch is moving through the scanner is possible. A large volume of the tissue can be scanned in a relatively short time in spiral CT. All the variables of traditional CT also apply to spiral CT, however, scan pitch is an additional important factor that must be considered in spiral CT.\\n\\nPitch is a ratio of distance that patient\\'s couch travels during 360º gantry rotation to the section thickness. If the couch travels 10 mm during one rotation and the section thickness is 10 mm, the pitch would be 1 (one). The larger the pitch, more tissue can be imaged during the same scan interval.\\n\\nFor a spiral CT examination with a pitch of 1 (one), the dose to patient should be comparable with the dose delivered in a traditional CT of the same volume of the tissue. Patient dose is inversely proportional to pitch, as the pitch is increased, the dose at any point along the volume of tissue decreases and vice versa.\\n\\n6.5 Dental Radiology\\n\\nDental radiography is the process of taking the X-ray images (pictures) of a teeth, bones, and soft tissues around them to help find problems with the teeth. It is one of the most frequent type of radiology procedures performed. Although, exposure associated with dental radiology is relatively low, however, radiological procedure should be justified and optimized to keep the radiation risk as low as reasonably possible. In dental radiology, ESD without backscatter for intraoral examinations and the Dose Width Product (DWP) for panoramic examinations is recommended for the setting of Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) [5].\\n\\n6.5.1 Factors Contributing Dose Variation\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nCollimation, Field- Size Trimming: Rectangular collimation which approximates the size and shape of the receptor reduces the dose significantly in comparison with circular collimation. A dose reduction exceeding 60% can be achieved in dental radiology by using rectangular collimation. Choice of Image Receptor: Digital detectors have the potential for further dose reduction, even compared with F-speed film, provided the repeat rate and use of\\n\\n9\\n\\nhigher exposure factors than necessary are controlled. The fastest available film consistent with achieving satisfactory diagnostic results should be used. E-speed and F-speed films reduce doses more than 50% compared with D-speed films.\\n\\niii. X-ray Generation and Kilo-voltage: For dental radiology, 65-70 kV is recommended as kilo-voltage of choice in intraoral X-ray sets using AC equipment, with 60 kV for those using DC X-ray sets.\\n\\niv. Filtration: X-ray tube filtration should be sufficient to reduce entrance surface dose to the patient consistent with producing satisfactory image quality. Filtration by aluminum is a key method of reducing skin dose to patients. Position Indication Device: A position indication device which ensures minimum focus-to-skin distance of 20 cm should be attached to the tube head (e.g. by use of a long collimator/cone as compared to a short conical one).\\n\\nv.\\n\\n6.6\\n\\nIn Utero Exposure in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\nPNRA Regulations on Radiation Protection (PAK/904), requires medical practitioners to avoid exposure to abdomen or pelvis of women patients who are or likely to be pregnant. If the exposure to any other body part or even to the abdomen/pelvis is justified, the medical practitioner is required to plan and conduct the exposure appropriately.\\n\\n6.6.1 Factors Affecting Fetal Dose in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nDirect (inside field of view) Exposure: If a fetus is located within the field of view of a particular examination, such as studies of the abdomen, pelvis and lumbar spine, it is exposed directly to primary beam radiation. This situation typically results in the highest fetal doses. Shielding in such situations becomes ineffective because it cannot cover the area being imaged. Indirect (outside field of view) Exposure: In case of examinations of skull and extremities, bulk of the exposure received by a fetus is from indirect scattered radiation from maternal tissues. The dose received in this situation is lower than the direct exposure. Shielding in this situation is again of limited value as most of the fetal dose results from internal scatter in the mother.\\n\\n6.6.2 Fetal Dose Estimation in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\nFetal doses are estimated using the following imaging techniques:\\n\\ni. Output intensity (measured in exposure or air kerma) of the X-ray equipment for diagnostic exposures, entrance exposure (or air kerma rate) and fluoroscopic exposures, along with the conditions of the examination should be known; The Half-Value Layer (HVL) should be used to determine beam penetrability; Information about the conditions of procedure should include the location, number of images taken and radiographic exposure factors; For fluoroscopic procedures, the beam-on time and number of digital or cassette spot images taken should also be known;\\n\\nii. iii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\n10\\n\\nv.\\n\\nPatient information should include fetal age at the time of exposure, patient\\'s size and thickness, depth of fetus, and orientation of patient.\\n\\nAccording to the data published in the Article of Radiographics [4], estimated doses to\\n\\nuterus from typical diagnostic procedures are listed in the Table-1.\\n\\nTable-1 : Estimated Doses to the Uterus from Typical Diagnostic Procedures\\n\\nEXAMINATION\\n\\nABSORBED DOSE mGy mrad\\n\\nUpper Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) Series\\n\\n1\\n\\n100\\n\\nCholecystography\\n\\n1\\n\\n100\\n\\nLumbar Spine Radiography\\n\\n4\\n\\n400\\n\\nPelvic Radiography\\n\\n2\\n\\n200\\n\\nHip and Femur Radiography\\n\\n3\\n\\n300\\n\\nRetrograde Pyelography\\n\\n6\\n\\n600\\n\\nBarium Enema Study\\n\\n10\\n\\n1000\\n\\nAbdominal Radiography (KUB)\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n250\\n\\nHysterosalpingography (HSG)\\n\\n10\\n\\n1000\\n\\nCT Ÿ Head Ÿ Chest Ÿ Abdomen\\n\\nApprox 0 0.16 30\\n\\nApprox 0 16 3000\\n\\nThe medical/health professionals at a diagnostic radiology facility should be aware of the effect of the factors/technical parameters such as KVp, mAs, collimation etc. on dose and image quality and they should select appropriate parameters, as relevant, such that their combination produce the minimum patient exposure consistent with the acceptable image quality and clinical purpose of the examination.\\n\\n6.7 Film Processing\\n\\nPatients may undergo repeated X-ray examinations after their initial X-ray radiographs are rejected due to poor image quality. Good quality of radiographs cannot be acquired without proper film processing.\\n\\nIn manual processing, technical factors, such as developer temperature, developing time and chemistry replenishment, affect the quality of the films and are much more difficult to control. The darkrooms, in manual processing, should be equipped with a timer and\\n\\n11\\n\\nthermometer, and a time-temperature development table which should be followed for processing all the films.\\n\\nAutomatic film processing is preferred because of less processing time. The film processor should be used according to the manufacturer\\'s recommendations. If temperature, transport rate or replenishment rates differ substantially from the recommended values, the effects on the image quality can be significant which may lead to modification of radiographic techniques that in turn directly affect patient\\'s dose.\\n\\nFilm processing conditions are also important in mammography. Manufacturer\\'s recommendations for processing should be strictly followed. Deviations can lead to use of improper exposure techniques thereby increasing the patient dose. Another consideration is the length of film-processing cycle which can be either standard or extended. Extended cycle and processing allows a decrease in dose required to produce acceptable images. However, not all mammography films are compatible with extended-cycle processing.\\n\\n7 MANAGING PATIENT DOSES\\n\\nThe factors affecting the management of patient doses are described in the following\\n\\nsections:\\n\\n7.1 Developments in Equipments and Accessories\\n\\nTechnical development that made most significant contribution to patient dose reduction is the intensifying screen. From direct film radiography to modern rare earth phosphors (typically Oxysulphides or Oxybromides of Gadolinium and Lanthanum), dose reduction of a factor of 15-500 have been made possible, depending upon the type of screen and film used. Rare earth screens have three to five times better dose efficiency as compared to Calcium Tungstate screens which are still in common use [7]. Spectral sensitivity of a film should match the emission spectrum of the intensifying screen used. Any mismatch will have financial implications and it may lead to increased radiation doses to the patients. There is thus an immediate scope for dose reduction by switching over to rare earth screens.\\n\\nEquipment with unsatisfactory safety and quality features should not be operated. Type approval of X-ray machines and registration may serve as an efficient method of ensuring conformity to specifications. New X-ray equipments may have malfunctions in one or more of their radiological parameters including; kVp, timing, beam congruence or centering and milli- ampere second linearity of some of their mechanical parameters which can be detected by acceptance testing. A qualified person, preferably a radiology medical physicist, may use these tests to verify that the initial performance of the equipment conforms to the manufacturer\\'s specifications and international standards [8,9]. The person testing the equipment should thoroughly document the results of acceptance tests as those results might be used in part to define the acceptable range of parameters that will be monitored in any subsequent test. If no acceptance testing is carried out, there are 80% chances of starting with a\\n\\n12\\n\\npoorly functioning unit.\\n\\nAfter successful installation and acceptance of equipment, QC testing of the equipment must be carried out on an ongoing basis for continued and reliable performance. A medical physicist should perform QC testing of the equipment at a defined frequency to look for changes that may cause degradation of image quality or an increase in radiation exposure to patient.\\n\\nMoreover, maintenance policy should be established for the maintenance of older equipment to avoid unnecessary exposures. Replacing/changing some of the accessories may also result in a patient dose reduction. Considerable attention should be given to introduction of Carbon fibers in table tops. Typically the dose can be reduced by 3-15% by changing the table top, 6-12% by changing the front of film cassette and 20-30% by using a grid with carbon fiber covers and fiber interspaces [10].\\n\\n7.2 Referrals\\n\\nRadiological examination is advised by the physicians to establish a diagnosis, however, not all the diagnostic examinations are clinically helpful. Expertise of physician, referring diagnostic examination, can help in saving the potential collective dose. Evidence based medicine has become an accepted practice, along with evidence based radiology.\\n\\nThe referring physician bears special responsibility and should use guidelines for diagnosis to a greater extent. The referring physician should take into account all clinical aspects regarding management of every patient individually/separately. In difficult cases, they should also consult with their colleagues in radiology in the selection of the most suitable procedure. Other possible procedures with lower or no exposure, such as USG or MRI, should be considered, if and when appropriate, before proceeding to radiological procedures.\\n\\n7.3 Education and Training\\n\\nThe personnel involved in advice and delivery of any radiology examination should be qualified and receive adequate training. The role played by training and education must be emphasized when it comes to the dose reductions possible in the hands of operators, developing expertise to advice manufacturers, making the right choice of equipment at the time of purchase and spreading a culture of radiation protection among the personnel. A substantial dose reduction (nearly 40%) can be achieved by training of the staff. This is the responsibility of the licensee to plan and execute effective training and re-training programs for its workers.\\n\\n7.4 Dose Guidance Levels\\n\\nPatient doses in diagnostic examinations are controlled by restricting dose up to a certain level, specific for an examination, suggesting that the dose is sufficient to create better quality\\n\\n13\\n\\nimage of human anatomy. Dose guidance levels have been replaced by dose reference levels in recent recommendations of ICRP on radiation protection [11]. The dose guidance levels for conventional radiography, computed tomography and mammography are given in Table-2, Table-3 and Table-4 respectively [3].\\n\\nTable-2 : Dose Guidance Levels for Conventional Radiography\\n\\nExamination\\n\\nEntrance Surface Dose per Radiograph* (mGy)\\n\\nLumbar Spine\\n\\nAP LAT\\n\\n10 30\\n\\nAbdomen, Intravenous Urology and Cholecystography\\n\\nLSJ AP\\n\\n40 10\\n\\nPelvis\\n\\nAP\\n\\n10\\n\\nHip joint\\n\\nAP\\n\\n10\\n\\nChest\\n\\nPA LAT\\n\\n0.4 1.5\\n\\nDental\\n\\nLAT Periapical AP PA\\n\\n20 07 05 05\\n\\nSkull\\n\\nLAT\\n\\n03\\n\\nNotes: PA: posterior-anterior projection; LAT: lateral projection; LSJ: lumbo-sacral-joint projection;\\n\\nAP: anterior-posterior projection.\\n\\nIn air with backscatter, these values are for conventional film-screen combination in the relative speed of 200. For high speed film-screen combinations (400- 600), the values should be reduced by a factor of 2 to 3.\\n\\nTable-3: Dose Guidance Levels for Computed Tomography\\n\\nExamination\\n\\nMultiple Scan Average Dose* (mGy)\\n\\nHead\\n\\n50\\n\\nLumbar Spine\\n\\n35\\n\\nAbdomen\\n\\n25\\n\\nDerived from measurements on the axis of rotation in water equivalent phantoms, 15 cm in length and 16 cm (head) and 30 cm (lumbar spine and abdomen) in diameter.\\n\\n14\\n\\nTable-4: Dose Guidance Levels for Mammography\\n\\nAverage Glandular dose (mGy) per Cranio-Caudal Projection*\\n\\n1 (without grid) 3 (with grid)\\n\\nDetermined in a 4.5 cm compressed breast consisting of 50 % glandular and 50 % adipose tissue, for film-screen systems and dedicated Mo-target Mo-filter mammography units.\\n\\nDose guidance levels have been established through worldwide survey practices. With the improvement of imaging technology, the radiation doses in an examination can be significantly reduced with good image quality. Furthermore, better performance and selection of proper technique in the same examination for different human beings further reduce the population dose. Many countries all over the world perform periodic surveys to assess the patient doses in diagnostic examinations. On the basis of the results thus obtained, the guidance levels are revised to lower doses.\\n\\n7.5 Clinical Dosimetry in Radiology\\n\\nRadiation protection of patients undergoing medical X-ray examinations is governed by the principles of justification and optimization. Radiation dosimetry is required to inform medical practitioners of the levels of exposure and hence the risks associated with the diagnostic procedures that they have to justify and to assist the operators of X-ray imaging equipment to determine whether their procedures are optimized. The dosimetric quantities to be considered during diagnostic work are:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nESD for individual radiographs; Dose-Area Product (DAP) for individual radiographs; DAP for complete examinations involving radiography and/or fluoroscopy; Weighted CT Dose Index (CTDIw) per slice in spiral CT scanning or per rotation in helical CT scanning; Dose-Length Product (DLP) per complete CT examination.\\n\\n7.5.1 Entrance Surface Dose\\n\\nIt is the entrance air Kerma with backscatter from patient skin. It is usually expressed in milligray (mGy) and can be measured directly with suitably calibrated TLDs attached to the patient\\'s skin or with ionization chambers supported in free air on the X-ray beam axis, corrected to the Focus Skin Distance (FSD) and by a suitable backscatter factor. It is the quantity of more concern for practical patient dosimetry. Specific X-ray tube output measurements, as a function of tube voltage (kV) and charge (mAs) made during routine quality assurance programs, are frequently used to calculate ESD values from the exposure parameters (kV, mAs, FSD) used for radiographs on a particular patient [12].\\n\\n15\\n\\n7.5.2 Dose Area Product\\n\\nIt is the absorbed dose to air (or the air kerma) averaged over the area of X-ray beam in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis, multiplied by the area of beam (A) in the same plane. It is usually expressed in Gy-cm2 and being invariant with distance from X-ray tube focus, it is conveniently measured with special large area ionization chambers (DAP meters) attached to the diaphragm housing of the X-ray tube, which intercept the entire cross section of the beam. They essentially integrate the absorbed dose over whole beam area for any number of diagnostic or fluoroscopic exposures and can thus provide a single measurement of total amount of radiation used in a complete X-ray examination involving radiography and fluoroscopy. DAP meters should be calibrated after installation on an X-ray set to take account of the particular scatter conditions and attenuating material between the DAP meter and the patient (e.g. the table top for under-couch X-ray tubes) [12].\\n\\n7.5.3 CT Dose Index\\n\\nThe principal dosimetric quantity used in CT is the CTDI. This is defined as the integral along a line parallel to the axis of rotation (z) of the dose profile [D(z)] for a single rotation and a fixed table position, divided by the nominal thickness of the X-ray beam. CTDI can be conveniently assessed using a pencil ionization chamber with an active length of 100 mm, so as to provide a measurement of CTDI100, expressed in terms of absorbed dose to air (mGy) [13].\\n\\nWhere \"n\" is the number of tomographic slices, each of nominal thickness \"T\", imaged\\n\\nduring a single rotation.\\n\\n7.6 Assessment of Exposure to the Patient at Individual X-ray Facilities\\n\\nPatient exposure assessment should always be associated with monitoring image information. Patient exposure and image quality assessments at individual facilities should be carried out on a sample of typical patients.\\n\\nAssessment of patient doses serve the following purposes:\\n\\ni. ii. Comparing doses and dose distributions for the same type of examination, done with different exposure parameters or with different equipment, or in different X-ray rooms or different hospitals or different countries, or to monitor improvement by making comparisons before and after changes;\\n\\nEstablishing guidance levels (reference levels);\\n\\niii. Comparing patient exposure for different types of examinations. Effective dose is, therefore, used for comparison; however, the caution of using effective doses for patients as indicated in UNSCEAR should be kept in mind;\\n\\niv. Assessing relative contributions to collective doses from various types of examinations or even comparing medical with non-medical radiation exposure of\\n\\n16\\n\\n8\\n\\nthe population;\\n\\nv. Analyzing trends in the use of radiation e.g. change in frequency and dose per examination, introduction of new examination techniques or modification of techniques; and\\n\\nvi. Comparison of patient doses with guidance levels to get an idea if doses are on the\\n\\nhigh side.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIAEA, \"Radiation Doses in Diagnostic Radiology and Methods for Dose Reduction\", TECDOC-796, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna (1995)\\n\\n2.

They should be fulfilled by the users prior to issuance of a license.\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nThis guide is prepared in support to “Regulations on Radiation protection (PAK- 904)” and “Regulations for Licensing of Radiation Facilities other than Nuclear Installations (PAK-908)”.\\n\\nNuclear medicine has three major concerns: efficacy, quality of life and safety. An integrated QA approach, taking into account medical, physical and radiation safety aspects, can improve nuclear medicine in achieving adequate image quality at the lowest reasonable doses to the patients.\\n\\nThe responsibility of QA/QC lies with the licensee/user. However, this guide provides an outline of a QA programme which encompasses the overall QA of a nuclear medicine facility. In the light of this guide, the user may develop their respective QA/QC protocols. For further reference Guidelines on Radiation Safety and Regulatory Requirements for Nuclear Medicine Facilities can be consulted.\\n\\nTheAuthority in this guide means Pakistan Nuclear RegulatoryAuthority.\\n\\n2\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective is to provide a baseline to the licensee for the establishment of a comprehensive QA programme to ensure radiation protection and safety so that all necessary procedures are developed and implemented according to Radiation Protection Regulations (PAK-904) within the country.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThe scope of the guide is to address all areas in a nuclear medicine department where QA protocols are essential for ensuring radiation protection and safety. It includes not only QA of the instruments and radiopharmaceuticals but also addresses all administrative and technical parameters that are an integral part of a comprehensive QAprogramme.\\n\\n4\\n\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY ASSURANCE:\\n\\nThree basic principles in a nuclear medicine department are:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nImprovement in the quality of diagnostic information; Acquisition of desired results with minimum amount of radionuclide activity; and Appropriate use of available resources so that the facility can be upgraded to cope with the advance technology.\\n\\nAQAProgram should include the following parameters:\\n\\nI.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii. iv.\\n\\nPhysical parameters of the radiation generators, imaging devices and irradiation installation at the time of commissioning and periodically thereafter; Means for verification of the appropriate physical and clinical factors used for diagnosis and therapy; Written records of relevant procedures & results; Verification of the appropriate calibration and conditions of operation of\\n\\n2\\n\\nv.\\n\\ndosimetry and monitoring equipment; and Regular and independent quality audit.\\n\\n5\\n\\nOPTIMIZATION OF QA\\n\\n5.1\\n\\nDesign of the Facility\\n\\nThe design of the facility should take into consideration:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nThe type of work and the radionuclides and their activities intended to be used; Categorization of hazards to determine the special needs concerning ventilation, plumbing, materials used in walls, floors and work benches; The layout of a typical nuclear medicine department and building requirements is given inAnnexure I.\\n\\n5.2\\n\\nQA Program Organization\\n\\nIt includes:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nProcedures: The procedures include patient history, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, appropriateness of investigation, precautions to be taken and any contraindications, etc; Planning of procedures: This means that appropriately defined administrative procedures, patient system, patient preparation areas etc; Clinical procedures: It means that procedures for the purchase of equipment, radiopharmaceuticals etc are defined and only approved suppliers are listed. In addition, storage & preparation of radiopharmaceuticals, clinical environment, patient handling & preparation, equipment acquisition and performance protocols and waste disposal procedures must be available; All medical and paramedical staff in a nuclear medicine department should be qualified and have on the job training on radtiation protection. Data analysis: It means that processing protocols, equipment performance, data accuracy and integrity protocols must be established; Report: QA should also be maintained while acquiring data, image review and results with further advice, etc; General outcome: It means that the general outcome of a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure should be according to the satisfaction of the physician as well as the patient; and Audit.\\n\\nthe facility should have information\\n\\nviii.\\n\\n5.3\\n\\nFacility Organization\\n\\nIt is advisable that the department establishes a QA group/committee that is\\n\\nresponsible for quality assurance issues.\\n\\nWhile defining a QACommittee, the following criteria must be kept in mind:\\n\\nI.\\n\\nMust be chaired by the Head of the Department;\\n\\n3\\n\\n6\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii. iv. v. vi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nMust include a nuclear medicine specialist, a medical physicist, the chief technician, a pharmacist and an engineer responsible for service and maintenance; Must be appointed and supported by senior management; Must represent many disciplines within the department; Must have depth of knowledge and experience; Must have authority to exercise the powers to instigate and carry out the QA process; and Should be accessible.\\n\\nThe QACommittee is responsible for:\\n\\nI.\\n\\nii. iii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nEstablishing a comprehensive QA programme for radiation protection, safety and image quality to ensure that all necessary procedures are developed and implemented to comply with the Radiation Protection Regulations (PAK-904) within the terms and conditions of the authorization(s) of the facility; Define policies and procedures to ensure quality patient care; Provide assistance to the staff in tailoring the programme to meet the needs of the department; and Systematically reviewing and auditing the entire QA programme such as administrative routines, working procedures, procedure manuals, follow up of examinations and treatments, quality control of equipment, routine purchasing of equipment etc. This is required to determine whether the activities conducted to obtain images of good quality are consistent with the current good medical practice and are carried out in a safe manner.\\n\\nADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES\\n\\nAn appropriate administrative routine is an important part of a QA program. This includes patient identification, patient information, type of study and justification of the request, selection of examination protocols, diagnostic reports and records. Following criteria must be followed;\\n\\nI.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv. v.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nThe request of a nuclear medicine examination must be from a nuclear medicine specialist; Any request of nuclear medicine examination advised by a physician outside the facility should be justified and evaluated by the nuclear medicine specialist; Nuclear medicine specialist of the facility should communicate with the referring physician; Special consideration should be given to children and pregnant women; Patient identification should follow the hospital routines. A proper system of identification will prevent examination or treatment of the wrong patient; Every request must include patient identity, information about the desired examination, any required pre-medication, any contraindications and waiting for the examination; It is recommended that a procedure manual is made available for each type of examination. This manual should have:\\n\\n4\\n\\na.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nc.\\n\\nd.\\n\\ne. f.\\n\\nClear and concise statements of all the policies and procedures carried out within the department; The manual should be reviewed and updated annually to accommodate new techniques; Administrative, clinical and radiation safety aspects need to be defined separately; It should be signed by the Head of the radiation facility and head of nuclear medicine department; It should incorporate opinions of all the concerned departments; and It should be accessible to all.\\n\\nThe administrative routines in a hospital clinical practice should include the\\n\\nfollowing basic information:\\n\\ni. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. ix. x. xi. xii.\\n\\nRequired study; Preparation of the patient; Radiopharmaceuticals required; Route of administration; Activity requested; Type of examination required; Views desired; Scanning speed; Required collimator; Required window setting; Positioning of the patient for that particular test; and Presentation of results.\\n\\nEfficient use of computers can increase the sensitivity and specificity of an examination.

They must include visual inspection of the package and monitoring of external radiation levels and removable contamination if the package is damaged, verification that the contents confirm with the packing slip and with the purchase order and monitoring of the packing material and empty package.\\n\\nFor further details PNRA “Guidelines on Radiation Safety and Regulatory\\n\\nRequirements for Nuclear Medicine Facilities” may be consulted.\\n\\n7.1.2\\n\\nCheck of Sources\\n\\nThe procedures should include provision for safe handling of sources and the\\n\\nverification of activity.\\n\\n7.1.3\\n\\nStorage\\n\\nProcedures should include the use of appropriate shielding, choice of an appropriate location and a check of the external dose rate to verify that it does not exceed the limits specified. Radiation level limits for various labeled packages are given in table 1.\\n\\nFor storage of radionuclides like I-131, the following precautions should be\\n\\nfollowed:\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nIt should be stored in a controlled area; It should always be stored in a lead container and preferably in fume hood or refrigerator to prevent evaporation; and In order to reach an acceptable external dose rate, 1.4 cm thick lead shield is required.\\n\\n7\\n\\nTable 1: Radiation Level Limits for Labeled Packages\\n\\nTRANSPORT INDEX (TI)\\n\\nMAXIMUM RADIATION LEVEL AT ANY POINT ON EXTERNAL SURFACE\\n\\nCATEGORY\\n\\n0a\\n\\nNot more than 0.005mSv/h\\n\\nWhite – I\\n\\nMore than 0 but not more than 1a\\n\\nMore than 0.005mSv/h but not more than 0.5mSv/h\\n\\nYellow – II\\n\\nMore than 1 but not more than 10\\n\\nMore than 0.5 mSv/h but not more than 2 mSv/h\\n\\nYellow – III\\n\\nMore than 10\\n\\nMore than 2 mSv/h but not more than 10 mSv/h\\n\\nYellow - IIIb\\n\\na = The TI shall be rounded up to the first decimal place except that a value of 0.05 or less may be considered as zero. b = shall be transported under exclusive use.\\n\\n7.1.4\\n\\nHandling of Radioactive Waste\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of hospital management to collect, segregate and dispose off radioactive waste according to the Regulations on Radioactive Waste Management (PAK-915). For further reference, PNRA Safety Guide “Guidelines for the Management of Radioactive Waste in Hospitals/Nuclear medical Centres/Research Facilities (13002)” may be consulted.\\n\\n7.1.5\\n\\nSource Transport\\n\\nThe hospital administration/person responsible should make local rules for in-\\n\\nhouse transport of radioactive material.\\n\\nIf the injection is to be taken far from the dispensing room for administration to the patient, a transport container with absorbent pads need to be provided. The RPO must ensure that the container is labeled with a radiation warning sign. It must also have the following information: date, activity, name & identification number of the patient for which the injection is prepared, name of the technologist who prepared the dose and the name of the medical professional who prescribed the dose.\\n\\nRPO must ensure that the most direct route is taken for transport avoiding\\n\\nheavily occupied areas and the time taken in the transport must be documented.\\n\\nArecord of all these measures must be kept.\\n\\nThe transportation of sources and radiopharmaceutical are subject to the\\n\\nRegulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material Pak/916.\\n\\n8\\n\\nRADIOPHARMACEUTICALS\\n\\nIn nuclear medicine it is desirable to use relatively short-lived agents which can\\n\\nbe delivered to hospitals & clinics from commercial sources. The nuclear medicine department needs to have a qualified radiopharmacist or a radiochemist. The following are the responsibilities of a radiopharmacist/radiochemist:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n99\\n\\n99m\\n\\nElution of sterile pertechnetate from a Mo/ Tc generator;\\n\\n8\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPreparation of radiopharmaceuticals according to manufacturer\\'s instructions;\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPerformance of quality control procedures on the prepared radiopharmaceuticals.\\n\\nIf a radiopharmacist / radiochemist is not available, the nuclear medicine\\n\\ntechnologist is responsible to carry out these additional responsibilities.\\n\\n8.1\\n\\nRadionuclide Generators\\n\\n99\\n\\n99m\\n\\nThe most important generator is the Mo / Tc system. Commercial generator systems are autoclaved & the elution dynamics quality controlled before shipment. However, each laboratory must perform quality control steps each time the generator is eluted.\\n\\n8.1.1\\n\\nRadionuclide Purity\\n\\n99\\n\\n99m\\n\\n99m\\n\\nThe only desired radionuclide in the Mo/ Tc generator eluate is Tc. Any other radionuclide in the sample is considered an impurity. The amount of Mo in the eluate is subject to limits & must be tested on each elution. The set limit is 0.15µCi of Mo activity per 1.0 mCi of\\n\\n99\\n\\n99m\\n\\nTc activity in the administered dose.\\n\\n8.1.2\\n\\nChemical Purity\\n\\nAnother routine QA step is to measure the generator eluate for the presence of\\n\\nAl O . For fission generators the maximum alumina concentration is10µg/ml.\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n8.1.3\\n\\nRadiochemical Purity\\n\\n99m\\n\\nThe standard set for the generator eluate is that 95 % or more of Tc activity\\n\\nshould be in + 7 states.\\n\\n8.2\\n\\nRadiopharmaceutical Behavior\\n\\nThe behavior of radiopharmaceuticals is dependent upon its quality, which demands high standards of radionuclide, radiochemical and chemical purity and, in case of suspensions, of particle size and uniformity. Injections have to satisfy additional standards of sterility, apyrogenicity and freedom from foreign particulate matter.\\n\\n8.2.1\\n\\nRadionuclide Purity\\n\\nRadionuclide purity is required to avoid unnecessary radiation dose to the patient, to avoid degradation of image quality and to limit errors on measurements. Radionuclide purity depends upon the half-lives of the radionuclides involved. Contaminants with longer half-lives are potentially more hazardous.\\n\\n8.2.2\\n\\nRadiochemical Purity\\n\\nready-to-administer radiopharmaceutical are used or else prepared through the reconstitution of non- radioactive kits by adding a radionuclide. The manufacturing of ready-to-inject radiopharmaceuticals and of non-radioactive kits is subject to quality control.\\n\\nIn a nuclear medicine department, either\\n\\n9\\n\\n99\\n\\n8.2.3\\n\\nChemical Purity and Content\\n\\nIn general, chemical impurities in radiopharmaceuticals are objectionable only\\n\\nif they are toxic or if they interfere or result in the modification of the desired study.\\n\\n8.2.4\\n\\npH\\n\\nThe pH of radiopharmaceutical injections and solutions should be within\\n\\nspecified range.\\n\\n8.2.5\\n\\nSpecific Activity\\n\\nControl of specific activity is particularly important in exchange radio-labeling\\n\\ne.g., in the labeling of an iodo compound by exchange with 123I or 131I.\\n\\n8.3\\n\\nPreparation of Radiopharmaceuticals\\n\\nThe following criteria need to be fulfilled:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\nWritten procedures must be followed in preparation to ensure safe handling of radiopharmaceuticals; Transparent vial shields should be used; A unique code must be followed which can be able to trace the original components in the preparation; Labeling of vials and syringes must be ensured; The activity should be measured; Protective clothing must be available; Tools for remote handling of radioactive material must be available; Containers for radioactive waste are available; Dose rate monitor with alarm should be there; The department should have contamination monitor; Adecontamination kit must be readily available; Appropriate warning signs and labels must be available; Records of radionuclides , kits etc must be maintained;\\n\\n8.4\\n\\nDispensing Radiopharmaceuticals\\n\\nThe following steps must be followed:\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\nCheck the kit & vial shield labels before dispensing; Draw the required volume and measure the activity; Dispense the radionuclide into a shielded syringe (bench top shield, vial shield, syringe shield); Keep the vial in fume hood and on a tray with lips, lined with plastic backed absorbent pads; Handle the vial with forceps or similar long handled instruments; Put the radionuclide in an infusion bottle; Line the bottle to the patient using an intravenous catheter; Keep the patient in bed until the bottle is empty; Cover the vial with lead after use; Check the activity; Remove the bottle and catheter or syringe and dispose them off as\\n\\n10\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nradioactive waste; Document each step;\\n\\n8.5\\n\\nAdministration of Radiopharmaceuticals\\n\\nAccording to the “Regulations on Radiation protection (PAK – 904)”, unsealed sources for nuclear medicine procedures should be calibrated in terms of activity of the radiopharmaceutical to be administered, the activity being determined and recorded at the time of administration.\\n\\nThe following information must be fulfilled prior\\n\\nto injecting\\n\\nradiopharmaceuticals:\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPatient name; Patient identification number – preferably it should include National Identity Card number as well; History of pregnancy and breast feeding from female patients; Check the request form – it should be signed by the nuclear medicine physician; Check the label of the syringe.\\n\\nAnnexure III describes safe administration of I-131 and guidance level.\\n\\n9\\n\\nWORK IN A CONTROLLED AREA\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nAccess to controlled areas must be limited; All regular staff of the area will be issued a personal dosimeter, worn at all times when the person enters the room; Occasional entry of any person without a dosimeter to a controlled area may be permitted under the supervision of an authorized member or RPO; Other personnel who need to enter the controlled area on occasional basis at times when they are not being supervised (works staff, contractors etc) must be issued with a permit to enter the controlled area; Outside normal working hours controlled areas must be locked to prevent unauthorized access.\\n\\nIn order to avoid skin contamination and/or accidental ingestion of\\n\\nradionuclides\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nLaboratory coats or other suitable clothing should be worn to prevent accidental contamination of normal clothes; Disposable plastic gloves should be worn when working with any unsealed sources; Lab coats should be removed and hands washed before eating or drinking and before going home; Disposable handkerchiefs should be used; Skin cuts and abrasions should be covered before working with unsealed sources; If there is any risk of splashing, eyes should be protected e.g., behind the transparent lead block; Mouth pipettes must never be used. Always use a bulb pipette or a syringe\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n11\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nfor measuring radioactive solutions. No one should eat, drink, smoke or apply cosmetics in controlled areas with the following exception:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEating, drinking by a patient as part of a diagnostic procedure e.g., iodine therapy procedure; Eating and drinking is allowed at the nursing station provided that no administration of radioactive substances is carried out at the time and if there is any contamination from previous administration, has been dealt with by qualified persons; In the waiting area, eating and drinking is allowed as the area is not used for administration of radiopharmaceuticals.\\n\\nHowever, if the area gets contaminated by the vomitus or urine or any other body fluids of the patient after radiopharmaceutical administration, the area should be treated as “controlled area”. No one should be allowed to eat and drink till the area is decontaminated and declared safe by RPO.\\n\\nTo avoid spread of contamination:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nActivity must not be splashed around e.g., do not squirt syringes or expel in the air; As far as practicable all operations involving unsealed sources should be carried out over a drip tray; Syringes containing radioactive solutions should be placed, with their shielding, in a tray before transportation; Any bench top which is used for the manipulation of unsealed sources e.g., blood samples, should be covered with absorbent paper which should be replaced if contamination occurs; and While wearing gloves which may be contaminated, unnecessary contact with all other objects should be avoided. Gloves should be removed and disposed off in the radioactive waste bin as soon as work with radioactive substances is finished.\\n\\nTo minimize the hazard from external radiation:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nSources must be kept within suitable lead shielding when not in use. Vials of activity should only be removed from their lead pots when this is absolutely necessary e.g., place in the ionization chamber; Unshielded vials of activity should only be manipulated with long handled tongs; Syringes containing radioactivity should be fitted with lead syringe shields whenever possible; Patient doses should be kept in the shielded storage area until required. Unused doses should be returned to the radionuclide lab at the end of each session; and Personnel should keep as far away as possible from all sources and organize work so as to minimize the time spent in close proximity to large sources e.g., stand back while the Tc generator is eluting.\\n\\n99m\\n\\n12\\n\\n10\\n\\nINSTRUMENTATION\\n\\nThe aim of the QA program for equipment used in nuclear medicine is the prediction or identification of significant changes in technical parameters that could result in a lower or otherwise unsustainable quality of diagnostic and therapeutic results. To make sure that the equipment is working correctly, the following conditions must be fulfilled:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nControls within the quality assurance system must be carried out with suitable frequency ( some daily, others over longer time intervals); Controls must be carried out with sufficient accuracy and reproduction under a procedure according to a clearly written protocol; The results of the controls – including the conditions under which these results have been measured – must be carefully documented. As an element of the controls, it must also be described what must be done in case the measurements are not satisfactory from the point of view of the established criteria.\\n\\nQA is essential not only for maintaining high standards of clinical practice but also for maintaining high performance of equipment. In each department there should be a continuous review process to monitor clinical and equipment performance in accordance with national and international standards. There should also be routines and a policy for purchasing equipment.\\n\\n10.1\\n\\nEquipment Purchase Rules\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of the hospital management to clearly define a policy for\\n\\npurchasing new equipment.\\n\\nThe facility administration should constitute a purchase group\\n\\ncomprising of the following:\\n\\ni. ii. iii. iv. v.\\n\\nNuclear Medicine Specialist; Medical Physicist; Nuclear Medicine Technologist; An Engineer; Aperson with authority from administration.\\n\\nThe need to purchase new equipment depends upon:\\n\\ni. ii. iii. iv.\\n\\nv. vi.\\n\\nStarting a new diagnostic facility; Increased workload of the patient; The technical performance is deteriorated; The equipment performance is not good enough for new techniques/methods; Spare parts are not available; and Un-repairable.\\n\\nChoice of equipment depends upon:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nType of procedures to be undertaken; Technical specifications;\\n\\n13\\n\\niii.

This is provided by the medical physicist in co-operation with the RPO; Measures to prevent use of equipment during periods of maintenance; Notification of the medical physicist whenever there is a repair regardless of its importance.

Before the equipment is introduced to its regular use after installation, it is important to check whether its detection parameters correspond to those as specified by the manufacturer in the accompanying documentation. Acceptance tests are also important after any considerable maintenance on the equipment. The aim of the acceptance tests is:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTo compare the measured values of parameters with the values specified by the manufacturer; To control all parameters and features of the equipment that can influence the outcomes of measurements (especially in case of scintillation cameras); and To obtain a basis for performing consistency/routine tests during the use of the equipment at a workplace.\\n\\nThe way the acceptance test is carried out and all criteria used in the test must be declared in the contract with the manufacturer. In this regard, one of the following options can be selected:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe supplier of the equipment himself carries out acceptance tests at the workplace where the equipment is installed in the presence of a specialist (a physician, medical physicist or a technician) of the facility; They are carried out by qualified persons , i.e., employees of the institution buying the equipment; and The supplier and the purchasing institute make an agreement that independent specialist will carry out the tests.\\n\\nRoutine/Consistency Tests\\n\\nWhen the acceptance testing has been completed satisfactorily, their results will provide a baseline data for carrying out routine/consistency checks. The aim of consistency / routine tests is:\\n\\n16\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTo check whether the measured values of the parameters are within the recommended tolerance range of parameters established at the workplace during the acceptance test; and To estimate both short term changes in parameters and long term trends in their gradual changes.\\n\\nThe routine/consistency tests can be distinguished between simple and\\n\\ncomplicated tests.\\n\\na.\\n\\nSimple Tests\\n\\nThese tests utilize a low time frame and are easy to carry out in periods ranging from a few minutes to half an hour, which is very important with regard to the frequent use of the equipment especially the scintillation cameras. Another important aspect of these tests is that they do not require much technical equipment and can be carried out by commonly available equipment which is usually not very expensive. The institute itself is responsible to perform these tests by utilizing existing means.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nComplicated Tests\\n\\nThe most important aspect of the complicated tests is that they require several hours for performance and much more specialized equipment is required or a combination of both. The institution may not have the capability to perform these tests itself. The institution must ask for assistance from the companies providing maintenance of medical equipment or make an agreement with a group of specialists in the field. Another alternative is that while purchasing the equipment, an agreement should be made with the supplier to include the complicated tests in the equipment warranty. However, an occasional consultation with an independent specialist in order to ensure the objectivity of such tests is nevertheless required.\\n\\nAnother important parameter of the QC tests is preventive maintenance of the equipment – examination, cleaning and changing of used parts; this helps to prevent sudden problems that affect the regular clinical operation.\\n\\nc. Analysis of Results\\n\\nThe results of acceptance and routine tests must be recorded carefully and for this\\n\\npurpose special records must be kept for every piece of equipment.\\n\\nIt is important to emphasize that the licensee, when assuring the quality of the equipment technology, must strictly follow the instruction of the supplier or the manufacturer listed in the accompanying directions and documentation.\\n\\n10.2\\n\\nEquipment Used in Nuclear Medicine\\n\\nThe following equipment is listed in the QAprogramme:\\n\\n1. 2.\\n\\nEquipment measuring activity of radiopharmaceuticals (calibrators); Single-detector equipment for measuring in vitro and in vivo (for for unscintigraphic examination) and multiple-detector equipment measuring in vitro;\\n\\n17\\n\\n3.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nImaging equipment (scintillation planar cameras, scintillation cameras for one-photon emission tomography – SPECT); Equipment for safety dosimetry (measuring equipment for input sources, surface contamination, operation dosimeters).\\n\\nControl of the quality of the activity-measuring instruments (calibrators)\\n\\nwith a well-ionizing chamber:\\n\\nThe consistency tests for calibrators are summarized as: (cid:3)\\n\\nSIMPLE (cid:4) (cid:4)\\n\\nBackground Stability (short term reproducibility)\\n\\n(cid:3)\\n\\nCOMPLICATED (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4)\\n\\nLong term reproducibility Calibration (measuring accuracy) Linearity Measuring geometry\\n\\nOverview of activity tests (calibrators) with the ionizing well chamber and\\n\\nfrequency of their application is shown in the table 2.\\n\\nThe licensee bears the responsibility of accuracy of radionuclide calibrator.As all calibrators show some dependence on measurement geometry that diminishes with increasing depth of the well, the nuclear medicine units will ensure that tables giving correction factors are applied in measurements on different radionuclides in syringes, vials & other containers of different sizes & types are being provided.\\n\\nThe records of QC tests must be maintained and provided to the Authority Inspectors on demand at the time of inspection. A full quality control report by a qualified medical physicist needs to be submitted to the RegulatoryAuthority annually.\\n\\nTABLE 2: Activity Tests with Ionizing Well Chamber & Their Frequency\\n\\nFREQUENCY\\n\\nTEST\\n\\nTYPE\\n\\nACCEPTANCE TEST\\n\\nDAILY\\n\\nONCE PER YEAR\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nx\\n\\nx\\n\\nSimple\\n\\nStability (short term reproducibility)\\n\\nx\\n\\nx\\n\\nLong term reproducibility\\n\\nx\\n\\nx\\n\\nCalibration (measuring accuracy)\\n\\nComplicated\\n\\nx\\n\\nx\\n\\nLinearity\\n\\nx\\n\\nx\\n\\nMeasuring geometry\\n\\nx\\n\\nx\\n\\n99\\n\\n99m\\n\\nDiagnostic nuclear medicine departments that use a Mo/ Tc generator or\\n\\n18\\n\\nprepare their own dosages are required to determine & record the activity of each dosage before medical use by direct measurement.

It must be 0.15µCi Mo/mCi Tc (0.15kBq Mo/MBq Tc). If this activity ratio is exceeded, the dosage cannot be administered.

For clinical radionuclides other than Tc, it is important to verify intrinsic uniformity with the appropriate corrections on a regular schedule, the frequency of which will depend on the variety of radionuclides used with a particular system; and\\n\\n99m\\n\\nii.\\n\\nVisual Inspection of Collimators: A visual inspection of collimators should be performed daily & whenever collimators are changed. Signs of denting, scratches, or stains should be followed with an extrinsic flood test & a background check before a suspect collimator is used for patient imaging.\\n\\nLESS FREQUENT TESTS\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nResolution Phantoms: Using a four quadrant bar pattern or some other repetitive pattern, such as holes, resolution & linearity of the entire surface of the camera can be judged. Compare the results with the reference image identically acquired at the time of known performance. Loss of resolution may indicate electronic noise or degradation of crystal or interface; Center of Rotation (COR) Test: COR testing should be performed as per recommended schedule of the manufacturer. It is recommended that COR testing be performed routinely on all collimators used for SPECT. Variable angle cameras should be checked for both the 90 & 180 degree positions, unless otherwise stated by the manufacturer. It is a good practice to look at per-view deviations from expected source positions which can indicate problems with mechanical alignment. It is desirable to rotate collimators systematically for the purpose of this test, so that a different collimator (or collimator set) is used for performing the test until all SPECT collimators have been tested;\\n\\n23\\n\\nTABLE 7: Tests for SPECT QC\\n\\nVARIABLES\\n\\nT N U O C M 5 : Y L A D\\n\\nI\\n\\nD O O L F\\n\\nM U R T C E P S K A E P\\n\\nW E V R E N C\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nW E V E R M A R G O N S\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nT N A R D A U Q 4\\n\\n)\\n\\nN O T U L O S E R\\n\\nI\\n\\n(\\n\\nM O T N A H P\\n\\nF O R E T N E C\\n\\nN O T A T O R\\n\\nI\\n\\nT N U O C H G H\\n\\nI\\n\\nC S N R T N\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nY T M R O F N U\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nM O T N A H P T C E P S\\n\\nD N U O R G K C A B\\n\\nK C E H C\\n\\nK C E H C T L T D A E H\\n\\nI\\n\\nD E T C U R T S N O C E R\\n\\nE C R U O S T N O P\\n\\nI\\n\\nCollimator Damage\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPMT Drift\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy Peak Drift\\n\\n0\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMechanical COR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\nElectronic Noise\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\nCrystal Damage/Coupling Dry\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContamination/Spills\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMagnetic Fields\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\nPower Fluctuations\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\nBackground\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTemperature Fluctuations\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAny Variable As a Function of Angle\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\nKey - 0 +\\n\\nSignifies that the test is unlikely to show sensitivity for the designated variable Signifies some sensitivity for the designated variable Signifies high sensitivity for the designated variable\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nHigh Count Intrinsic Uniformity Flood: High count density intrinsic floods should initially be acquired weekly; afterwards the frequency of the test is adjusted according to the camera\\'s stability. Departments using multiple radionuclides should rotate radionuclides used for this test & compare images to the baseline acquired with the same radionuclide; Tilt Angle of the Camera Head(s): For best results in SPECT, the detector head must be parallel to the axis of rotation (level). For manually positioned systems this must be verified at every acquisition; but even systems with motorized tilt angles need to be checked periodically. Verify that a level detector corresponds to a tilt indication of zero, at different radii of rotation.

This test can conveniently be carried out at the same time as a COR test (using the same point source). An offset point source will provide more information about camera performance than a source on axis, but when combining this test with the COR test, follow manufacturers recommendations; Reconstructed Cylindrical Phantom Uniformity: A frequency of once a month is recommended. This test will uncover any angular variations in camera performance that have not been picked up by other tests; SPECT Resolution & Uniformity Phantom Test: This test is recommended for QC purposes. When performed using the recommended phantom, and when acquired correctly, the analysis of the results of this test provides information on the complete SPECT imaging system, both hardware & software. This test may not specifically indicate the source of an error but when used routinely it provides a valuable trend analysis of total system performance. It is recommended that this phantom test be acquired initially at system acceptance and then quarterly thereafter. Results of all subsequent acquisitions should be compared to the baseline acceptance study; and Pixel Size: Pixel size is another parameter that affects SPECT image quality & quantization. This should be monitored more frequently in older SPECT systems. The newer digital cameras should be tested initially upon acceptance & then every six months thereafter following manufacturers\\' instructions.\\n\\nTable No: 8 outlines a summary of recommended SPECT QC Tests. The tests outlined are not performance tests; rather, the outcome of these tests is expected to change as the system performance changes.

It involves application of ionizing radiations e.g. X-rays and gamma rays to verify the physical integrity of items, equipment and structures such as vessels, pipes, welded joints, casting and other devices. Industrial radiography poses negligible risk if it is performed in a safe manner. However, experience shows that incidents involving industrial radiography sources have sometimes resulted in high doses to workers, causing severe health consequences such as radiation burns and, in a few cases, death. Members of the public have also suffered radiation overexposures when radioactive sources used for industrial radiography are not properly controlled or regulated. All such incidents demonstrate the necessity to have effective radiation safety infrastructure in place within the facilities; complemented with strong regulatory oversight to ensure highest level of safety. In order to control/eliminate such incidents in radiation facilities, PNRA has established requirements in the form of regulations called \"Regulations on Radiation Protection\" (PAK/904). This regulatory guide provides guidance to the licensee(s) and worker(s) to fulfill the purpose of these regulations effectively.\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION

in medicine, industry, agriculture and research. One of the foremost industrial applications of such radiation is the use of sources to verify the physical integrity of items, equipment and structures through non-destructive testing. The structural integrity of such equipment and structures affects not only the safety and quality of the products but also the protection of the workers, public and the environment.\\n\\nRadiography is a process in which radiation passes through an object/material under investigation and strikes at photographic film or some other digital detection system placed behind it. There is a partial absorption of the radiation beam as it passes through the object/material and it gives the detailed information in the form of final image on a photographic film or a digital detection system as illustrated in Figure 1.\\n\\nFigure 1 : Radiography Process\\n\\nThe ionizing radiation such as high energy gamma and X-rays are used for industrial radiography purposes worldwide because of their significant penetrating power. Apart from X- ray generators, examples of sealed radioactive sources (SRS) emitting gamma rays, used in industrial radiography, include Cobalt (Co-60), Iridium (Ir-192) and Cesium (Cs-137) etc.\\n\\nIndustrial radiography usually produces high doses and if a person is accidentally exposed to primary beam or comes in close contact with an unshielded radiography source (i.e. SRS), he might receive a dose that could result in severe deterministic health effects. Therefore, it requires high degree of professionalism which can only be achieved through effective management system, compliance with regulatory requirements, regulatory oversight and effective training/re-training of radiographers. A need to provide guidance to the licensee(s) of industrial radiography facilities, has been felt since long, to facilitate them in complying with the requirements regarding radiation protection. This regulatory guide has been prepared on the bases of the requirements established under regulation(s) 9, 10, 20, 25 to\\n\\n1\\n\\n30, 32 and 33 of \"Regulations on Radiation Protection\" - PAK/904 [1]. Moreover, guidance on the implementation of requirements of relevant regulation(s) of \"Regulations on Management of a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency\" - PAK/914 [2] and \"Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material\" - PAK/916 [3] have also been provided in this guide.\\n\\n2 OBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance to licensee(s) and worker(s)\\n\\nregarding radiation safety in industrial radiography.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThe guidance provided in this regulatory guide is applicable to the licensee(s) using radiation source(s) (i.e. SRS emitting gamma rays and X-ray generators) for the purpose of industrial radiography whether performed in a shielded enclosure or in a partially closed or open site.\\n\\n4\\n\\nDUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\\n\\nThe overall responsibility for radiation safety lies with the licensee. Specific duties and the day to day responsibilities for safe operation of radiography equipment, however, lie with a range of people, including management, the radiation protection officer (RPO), radiography crew, and, for site radiography work, the client is responsible for the premises where the site radiography work is carried out. All the duties and responsibilities should be identified, in writing, and agreed to by all the relevant personnel.\\n\\nThe licensee is responsible for the establishment and implementation of technical and organizational measures necessary to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and safety of the workers, public and the environment from harmful effects of radiations. The licensee should develop, implement, and maintain an overall management system of the facility that defines reporting hierarchy and responsibilities of all relevant individuals. General responsibilities of a licensee, RPO and the radiography crew may include the following:\\n\\n4.1 Responsibilities of an Owner/Licensee\\n\\n[4]\\n\\nThe owner/licensee of an industrial radiography facility should:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nDevelop detailed operating procedures and working rules prior to commencement of industrial radiography operation for the first time; Ensure that necessary infrastructure is available to enable the implementation of routine/emergency procedures and working rules, including provision of barriers, interlocks and warning signs;\\n\\niii.

Be familiar with:\\n\\na. Applicable regulatory requirements regarding industrial radiography; b. Use of radiation monitoring and personal protective equipment; c. Working rules/practices and emergency procedures.\\n\\niii. Ensure implementation of approved operating procedures and working rules\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nduring routine/emergency operations; Instruct and train the radiography crew, as necessary, in the safe use of equipment and appropriate radiation safety measures; Ensure that each radiation worker, who may be exposed to radiation during the course of radiography, uses appropriate radiation monitoring devices, including personal dosimeter;\\n\\nvi. Ensure that all necessary personal monitoring devices and radiation survey meters are available and in good working condition and are calibrated on regular intervals; vii. Ensure that personal dosimeters are issued and used by all the workers and their received doses are properly assessed and record is maintained in a proper documented form;\\n\\nviii. Ensure that all the equipment e.g. radiation monitoring devices, survey meters, source containers, shutters, source control mechanisms, interlocks are inspected and tested regularly;\\n\\nix. Ensure that the physical security requirements for source storage are properly\\n\\nx.\\n\\nimplemented; Ensure that radiography equipment is properly stored, with the source(s) located in fully shielded position, by monitoring at appropriate intervals;\\n\\nxi. Ensure that the requirements for safe transport of radiography sources are met.\\n\\n[4] 4.3 Responsibilities of Radiography Crew\\n\\nThe radiography crew is composed of operators/radiographers qualified and certified for conducting radiography operations. The crew is usually lead by a senior radiographer and assisted by other crew members. A senior radiographer (supervisor) should have the following responsibilities:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nEnsure that the crew is familiar with the basic knowledge of radiation protection;\\n\\n4\\n\\nii. Be familiar with radiography equipment and its use, approved working rules and applicable routine/emergency procedures and operate the equipment in accordance with approved procedures/working rules;\\n\\niii. Ensure that source(s) (SRS/X-ray generator) movement record is maintained with\\n\\nthe following details: a. Identification number of the source(s) and/or its container; b. Radioisotope and its current activity (in case of SRS); c. Location of sites where the source(s) is to be used; d. Date and time of source transfer/return; e. Name of the person, in whose name source(s) is issued.\\n\\niv. Ensure that all interlocks, shielding, collimator, warning signs, barriers and other protective devices are properly positioned, prior to operating the equipment, so that undue exposure of those not involved in radiography could be avoided, in particular, for partially enclosed and site radiography; Ensure that radiography equipment is not operated, if appropriate survey meter and personal dosimeter is not available;\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi. Ensure, by using an appropriate radiation survey meter, that source (i.e. SRS) has been returned to its fully shielded position after the completion of radiography; vii. Ensure that source (i.e. SRS) control or shutter mechanism is locked or otherwise secured in a fully shielded position and all port plugs are firmly secured in place, while returning the gamma-radiography equipment to the store;\\n\\nviii. Ensure that radiography equipment is not operated, if it is known or suspected to be malfunctioning/deteriorated/damaged and immediately report such circumstances to the owner/licensee or RPO for appropriate corrective/investigative action; ix. Ensure that the operation of radiography equipment is immediately stopped, by returning the source (i.e. SRS) to its fully shielded position, in the following circumstances: a. If malfunction occurs during radiography operation; b. If any person other than the radiography crew enters an area where the dose rate\\n\\nexceeds or might exceed the allowable regulatory limits;\\n\\nx.\\n\\nc. If the only available survey meter fails to function. Promptly take appropriate measures, in accordance with the approved emergency procedure, to bring the situation under control in the event of a radiation incident.\\n\\nThe assisting crew members should bear the following responsibilities:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nCarry out the duties/tasks as are assigned/delegated by the supervisor, in accordance with the established local rules;\\n\\nii. Operate radiography equipment only under the direct supervision of concerned\\n\\nsupervisor;\\n\\niii. Take over the responsibilities insofar, in the event of a supervisor being unable to\\n\\n5\\n\\ncarry out his duties, by ensuring the exposure to himself and other crew members remains within the regulatory limits.\\n\\n5\\n\\n[1] INDIVIDUAL MONITORING\\n\\nIndividual monitoring is a measure of radiation dose(s) to individual(s) for the estimation of exposure to radiation and the interpretation of corresponding results. Licensee/owner should ensure that radiation doses to radiography crew are assessed on regular intervals to ensure that doses are kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) and are below the limits of PAK/904.\\n\\nIndividual monitoring is recommended for the individual(s) who routinely work in a controlled area. It provides information about the magnitude and pattern of doses received by an individual. Such information is important for a number of reasons; which are described below:\\n\\ni. ii. iii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nIt enables to exercise control over radiation exposure of an individual; It demonstrates whether doses are being kept ALARA; It contributes to highlight unexpected high doses; enables to investigate the circumstances of overexposure; and helps to determine corrective actions to be taken, if necessary; It indicates the efficacy of radiation protection measures applied during routine work practices and measure improvement and/or deterioration in current work practices; It also highlights good or bad work practices, status of radiography equipment, and degradation of shielding or engineered safety systems.\\n\\nThe ultimate choice of the type of dosimeter, to be used by the radiographers, should be made by the RPO in consultation with a qualified expert in radiation dosimetry, if possible. In addition to fulfill various technical requirements, the parameters such as its availability, initial/running cost, its robustness, and applicable regulatory requirements should also be considered while choosing a specific dosimeter.\\n\\n5.1 Types of Dosimeters\\n\\nDosimeter is an instrument used for recording radiation dose to an individual. Dosimeters are used not only during routine working in a radiation area but are also used in the event of an emergency or an incident. There are two types of dosimeter which can be used for a short-term as well as for routine dose monitoring. These dosimeters are classified as active dosimeters and passive dosimeters. Necessary detail regarding these dosimeters is given below:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nActive or direct-reading dosimeters are used for short-term (from minutes up to few hours) dose assessment and provide an instantaneous dose and/or alarm at pre-set dose levels or dose-rate. These can be very useful in restricting exposures during\\n\\n6\\n\\nindustrial radiography. The examples of direct reading dosimeters are Pen Dosimeters and Electronic Personal Dosimeters (EPD). Pen Dosimeters are always used after calibration through its calibrator. Active dosimeters are intended to be used for providing real time indication of the dose being received during radiography and/or for providing a warning for high dose-rate. Common measuring range of such dosimeters is from one (1) µSv/hr to 100 mSv/hr.\\n\\nŸ Dosimeters used for routine monitoring are referred as passive dosimeters i.e. they require to be processed by a specialized dosimetry service provider, on periodic intervals, to assess the dose received by an individual. Examples of passive dosimeters used for dose assessment due to beta, gamma, X-rays and neutron radiations are Film Badges (FB) and Thermo-Luminescent Dosimeters (TLD). It is preferable to get such dosimeters (FB/TLD) read from an accredited dosimetry service provider on monthly basis for the assessment of dose received by the worker(s).\\n\\nFigure -2 given below, illustrate the examples of various types of (active and passive)\\n\\ndosimeters.\\n\\nPen Dosimeter\\n\\nCalibrator\\n\\nEPD\\n\\nFilm Badge\\n\\nTLD\\n\\nFigure 2: Types of Dosimeters\\n\\n5.2 Precautions for Dosimeter(s)\\n\\nTo ensure that a dosimeter provides an accurate assessment of the dose(s) to a\\n\\nradiographer, following guidelines should be followed:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nDosimeter(s) should be worn (only) by the radiographer, to whom it is issued; It should be worn at all times, when carrying out work with radiation;\\n\\n7\\n\\niii.\\n\\nIt should preferably be worn on chest or belt or in accordance with the recommendations of dosimetry service provider; It should be worn on inside of the apron, in case if lead apron is used during work;\\n\\niv. v. Whenever, hands are exposed to radiation, ring dosimeters should be worn facing\\n\\ntowards inside of the hand;\\n\\nvi. The measuring element should be correctly positioned in the dosimeter holder,\\n\\nboth for TLD and FB;\\n\\nvii. Care should be taken to avoid damaging the measuring element of the dosimeter because of their sensitivity (i.e. dosimeters must be protected against water, high temperature/pressure and physical impact);\\n\\nviii. It should not be exposed to radiation when not being worn by a radiographer (it\\n\\nshould be stored in an area away from radiation sources);\\n\\nix. Dosimeter(s) (TLD/FB) should be immediately sent for processing by the\\n\\ndosimetry service provider after the end of each term;\\n\\nx. Damaged dosimeter should not be used. If a radiographer suspects that the dosimeter is damaged or is exposed to radiation when not in use, RPO should be informed accordingly;\\n\\nxi. The RPO should inform PNRA and the dosimetry service provider about the lost or\\n\\ndamaged dosimeters and its replacement should be arranged as soon as possible.\\n\\n5.3 Unusual Dose\\n\\nRadiation doses received by radiographers are expected to be low, usually not exceeding 2-3 mSv in a year, provided that all safety measures/procedures are implemented. However, if an unusual high dose, e.g. several mSv in a year, is reported for a single dosimeter or radiographer then it is not usual and should not go un-checked. It might be the result of high workload, a maintenance activity or enactment of an emergency plan. It also indicates poor work practices or inadequate radiation protection arrangements by the licensee. Such deficiencies, if confirmed, should be rectified and reason(s) for any unusual dose should be investigated by the licensee/RPO. Records of such investigations should be maintained and PNRA should be informed accordingly.\\n\\n5.4\\n\\nInvestigation Levels\\n\\nPNRA Regulations on Radiation Protection (PAK/904) require that the licensee should establish investigation levels of dose(s) to individual(s). Such investigation levels are specific values of dose which, if exceeded, requires to be investigated. The purpose of such investigation is to determine the circumstances that gave rise to higher dose(s) and to make a judgment whether this dose is as low as reasonably achievable or not. It is important to note that the numerical value of a dose investigation level, established by the licensee, is always a fraction of a particular dose limit.\\n\\n8\\n\\nSuch investigation levels and corresponding actions to be taken, in the event of these being exceeded, may also be established by the Authority. Although, they are not regulatory binding, however, their use as means of ensuring safety of workers should not be ignored.\\n\\n5.5 Over Exposure\\n\\nAn overexposure is considered to have occurred when a particular dose limit, specified by PNRA, has been exceeded. Overexposure is most likely to occur as a result of an incident or accident. An individual or a radiographer who suspects that he had an overexposure, should immediately inform the RPO/Licensee. In case of an overexposure, the RPO/Licensee should immediately inform PNRA and carry out a detailed investigation to determine the reasons, including an assessment of dose(s) received by the individual/radiographer, and final conclusion thereof. The report of such investigation should be submitted to PNRA, as soon as possible. PNRA may also conduct further investigations, if so required.\\n\\n5.6 Health Surveillance\\n\\nThe Licensee/owner should develop and execute a program for health surveillance of workers and should make necessary arrangements for their health surveillance [1]. Initial health surveillance should be performed to assess whether a worker possesses an adequate level of fitness for the intended tasks and that he/she is psychologically suitable to work with radiation source(s). Whereas, the licensee/owner should make arrangements for annual health surveillance (medical examination) of the workers working in a controlled area to ensure that their health remains satisfactory. Such program should be based on general principles of occupational health as described in \"Factories Act 1934\" currently enforced in Pakistan.\\n\\n6 GAMMA RADIOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT\\n\\n[5]\\n\\nHigh activity sealed radioactive source(s), housed in a shielded exposure device, are commonly used in gamma radiography equipment. The source remains in the shielded exposure device unless used. It is exposed by remotely moving it from the shielded exposure device (e.g. by using push–pull wires) directly into an attached guide tube. It remains in the guide tube for the desired exposure time, after which it is drawn back into the shielded exposure device.\\n\\nThe equipment used for gamma radiography typically consists of several components such as a remote wind-out mechanism (often called a crank), connected to the radiography source (often called a \\'pigtail\\') inside a shielded exposure device, which is directly connected to the guide tube. Sealed sources used for gamma radiography are normally part of a source assembly (the pigtail) that is usually connected to the drive cable in source projection type systems. The design and operation of these various components of gamma radiography equipment are interrelated.\\n\\nGamma radiography equipment should be selected in a way to ensure uninterrupted\\n\\n9\\n\\noperation during radiography. Following features should be considered while selection of gamma radiography equipment:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nIt should be durable i.e. resistant to corrosion, radiation and high temperature; It should be capable to prevent the passage of water, sand and other foreign materials into its critical parts.\\n\\n6.1 Exposure Device\\n\\nThe exposure device (also called as gamma projector) incorporates various safety devices and features designed to reduce the risk of human error or equipment malfunction. The licensee/owner should ensure to use an exposure device that has been designed in compliance with the applicable international standards to ensure that minimum safety requirements are met and that the device and source combination is suitable for use for radiography purposes. It should be ensured that an appropriate source with maximum activity permitted is used in the exposure device (quoted for each radionuclide) for which it is designed. Since, design specifications of most exposure devices also meet the requirements for a Type B(U) transport package as specified in PNRA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material - PAK/916, therefore, these can also be used as transport package for the transportation of radiography source(s).\\n\\nEach exposure device (gamma projector), as illustrated in Figure-3, should be\\n\\npermanently and clearly labeled with the following details:\\n\\ni. Radiation warning sign (trefoil) and the word “RADIOACTIVE”; ii. Name of radionuclide and its maximum activity for which it is designed; iii. Name of radionuclide (SRS) in use, its serial number, activity along with reference\\n\\ndate;\\n\\niv. Type of container i.e. B(U) or B(M); v.\\n\\nLicensee\\'s name, address and contact number(s) for emergency situation.\\n\\nThe exposure device should have a locking mechanism. The locking should be designed on the principle of \"fail-to-lock\", if the source is not in its secured position. It should have an indicator to show whether the device is locked or not. The exposure device should be of such design that the source can only be moved, from its secured position, by a remote control (crank). When the source is in secured position, dose rate should not exceed 2 mSv/h on the\\n\\nFigure 3: Exposure Device (Gamma Projector)\\n\\n10\\n\\nsurface of the device and 0.01 mSv/h at a distance of one meter from the surface of the device. The remote control (crank) should also be capable to indicate clearly whether the source is in secured position or in exposed/working position.\\n\\n6.2 Drive Cable and Guide Tube\\n\\nAncillary equipment such as drive cable and guide tube are used to maximize the distance between the radiographer and source i.e. SRS. It has to be ensured that drive cable and guide tube are capable to withstand with the stresses caused during the use of gamma projector. Connections between the drive cable and source, and among the lengths/pieces of guide tube should be of such design that source can move freely when connections are properly made. The source should not become loose or stuck in the guide tube. It should be ensured that guide tube and openings of the exposure device are provided with covers to prevent dust from entering into the device.\\n\\n6.3 Recommendations for the Use of Drive Cable and Guide Tube\\n\\nLicensee should ensure to use such gamma radiography equipment and accessories i.e.\\n\\ndrive cable and guide tube which comply with the following recommendations:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nSuch guide tube should be used through which the source can move freely . Design of the end cap at exposure end of the guide tube should prevent inadvertent release of the source when it is fully projected; Open end of the guide tube should be caped to prevent ingress of dirt, grit and moisture and, if it is flexible, it should withstand repeated flexures without suffering permanent distortion. It should be capable to recover from any temporary distortion caused by a compressive load or flexure; Exposure end of the guide tube should be clamped in position during exposure without affecting free movement of cable and source, and should be fitted with a collimator;\\n\\niv. Where a cable is used to move the source, the coupling should ensure that during\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nradiography work, the source (or pigtail) is not detached inadvertently; Drive cable should typically be 7-15 m and the guide tubes should be 2–6.5 m long according to the actual conditions of exposure to ensure that source is controlled from a location where dose rate is minimum; The radiographer must know the distance through which the source is projected from its fully shielded position, through the wind out mechanism; In case the source is moved pneumatically, the guide tube should be provided with damping mechanisms, at both ends, to protect the source from damage.\\n\\n6.4 Collimators\\n\\nCollimators are beam limiting devices and are used to narrow/direct the beam of radiations in a particular direction. Radiographers should ensure that collimators are used, whenever possible, to reduce radiation levels and subsequent doses. Collimators are usually\\n\\n11\\n\\nmade of lead, tungsten or depleted uranium, and they can provide either panoramic or directional beams. The licensee should ensure that the collimators are compatible with the source assembly, so as to avoid the source to be stuck.\\n\\n6.5\\n\\nInstructions for Testing and Maintenance of Radiography Equipment\\n\\nThe maintenance consists of complete disassembly of the equipment and a detailed inspection of all the components. Worn or damaged parts should be replaced, wherever required, and suitable lubricant should be applied. The licensee should develop and implement a program for periodic testing/surveillance and preventive maintenance of radiography equipment and its accessories in the light of manufacturer\\'s instructions. It should be ensured that only vendor or specially trained radiographer(s) always perform testing/maintenance of radiography equipment. Records of all maintenance, including the replacement of parts, should be kept.\\n\\nPeriodic testing/surveillance of the following typical items/devices should be\\n\\nconsidered in the program:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nExposure device, to ensure that: a. Fittings and fasteners are tight; b. Locking mechanism functions properly; c. Radiation levels are normal; d. Connections of guide tube and remote control (crank) are secure; e. Pigtail connection to drive cable is secured, using a wear gauge. Remote control (crank) and guide tube(s), to ensure that: a. Fittings are tight; b. There are no indications of crushing, kinks or dents; c. Drive cable can move freely; d. Source (pigtail) tips are not worn through.\\n\\niii. Safety interlock components and emergency stop devices of shielded\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nenclosure(s), to ensure their normal operation; Inspection of critical safety components of radiography equipment and its accessories, at least once a year; Leak test of SRS as per method and frequency recommended by the source vendor or manufacturer.\\n\\n7\\n\\nX- RAY RADIOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT\\n\\n[4]\\n\\nThe most common type of X-ray generator used as radiography equipment is the conventional X-ray Tube; however, Linear Accelerators (LINACs) and Cyclotrons are also used in few specialized applications. Some typical examples of X-ray generators are illustrated in Figure-4.\\n\\n12\\n\\nFigure 4: X-ray Generator used for Industrial Radiography\\n\\nX-ray generators are mostly used for performing panoramic (radial beam) and\\n\\ndirectional exposures. The X-ray tube is connected by a cable to the control panel, which provides means for pre-selection and indication of operating parameters. Dose to a radiographer can be affected by the cable length, operating parameters (volts-kV and current- mA) and local shielding around the device being radiographed. Licensee should only use such X-ray generators that satisfy the following minimum safety standards.\\n\\n7.1 Electrical Safety\\n\\nElectrical safety in an X-ray generator indirectly contributes to radiation safety, since electrical faults in X-ray generators can sometimes result in serious accidents with radiological consequences. In particular, all metallic items including casings, interconnecting cables, power supply unit (transformer/generator), control equipment, tube assembly, warning signals, other safety devices should be electrically bonded together (earth bonding) and connected to earth (grounded). Advice on all electrical matters, as well as on inspection and testing, should be obtained from a qualified electrical engineer or specialized service engineer, if required.\\n\\n7.2 Cable Length\\n\\nWhere radiography cannot be carried out in a shielded enclosure, cable lengths should typically be not less than 20 meters for X-ray generators up to 300 kV and longer for higher energy equipment.\\n\\n7.3 Collimators and Beam Filters\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that the X-ray generators used for directional radiography should, wherever practicable, be fitted with collimators (sometimes called cones or diaphragms) to limit the beam size to the minimum compatible with the radiographic technique. Beam filters should be used to match the filtration with the work being undertaken.\\n\\n13\\n\\n7.4 Control Panel\\n\\nThe licensee should consider following features in a control panel while selecting an X-\\n\\nray equipment. It should bear:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nA label incorporating radiation warning sign (trefoil), a legend indicating that X- rays are emitted when the equipment is operating and a warning label (in a local language) prohibiting unauthorized use;\\n\\nii. A key switch to prevent unauthorized use of equipment. The key should be removable only when the switch is in \\'OFF\\' or \\'Standby\\' position (i.e. it should not be possible to lock the system in \\'ON\\' condition). Key positions should be clearly marked;\\n\\niii. A labeled warning light (fail-safe) which indicates that the equipment is\\n\\npowered/energized (i.e. ready to emit X-rays);\\n\\niv. A separate labeled warning light (fail-safe) which indicates that the equipment is\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nactually emitting X-rays; A timer that controls the exposure duration or \\'ON\\' switch that requires continuous pressure by a radiographer to maintain the generation of X-rays; Indicators that show the kilovolts (kV) and the current in milli-amperes (mA) when the X-ray beam is \\'ON\\';\\n\\nvii. A clearly labeled means to immediately terminate the generation of radiation.\\n\\n7.5 X-ray Tube Head\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that the X-ray tube head is supported in a suitable stand or clamped in a position to prevent it from inadvertently moving. Leakage radiation (i.e. leakage that passes through the sides of the device rather than pass from the beam aperture) should be restricted by good design and construction and its level should be specified by the manufacturer. The penetrating power of leakage radiation depends on the kilo voltage and is particularly significant above 500 kV. Maximum dose rates due to leakage radiation at the surface of the device and at one (1) meter from the X ray target should be obtained from the manufacturer/vendor. Typical maximum dose rate values from leakage radiation arising from commercial X-ray tubes are up to 100 μSv/h at one (1) meter from the target.\\n\\n7.6 Flash X-ray Units\\n\\nSome X-ray based radiography equipment emit very short pulses of X-rays and the exposure duration is set in terms of number of pulses. Such radiography equipment are called flash X-ray units. These are often small, portable, battery driven units and are mainly used for the radiography of items of low density or very low wall thickness. Whereas, large such units are less often used in shielded enclosures where high output and extremely short exposure is required. The licensee should apply the same precautions that are used for ordinary X-ray equipment along with any additional safety precautions as determined on the bases of dose assessment. Most survey/dose meters are not suitable for the measurement of dose around flash X-ray units because exposure duration is extremely short and their response time is\\n\\n14\\n\\nrelatively slow. Therefore, it is advisable to use suitable integrating survey/dose meters.\\n\\n7.7\\n\\nInspection, Testing and Maintenance of X-ray Equipment\\n\\nIn order to ensure continued radiography operations, the licensee should arrange both; the routine surveillance as well as formal inspections/maintenance of X-ray equipment (including all accessories) to be performed by the manufacturer/vendor or a qualified engineer. Licensee should ensure that equipment is not modified without prior assessment of the implications of the modification on its original design and the safety assessment. Any parts to be replaced should be procured from the authorized merchant in order to ensure designed safety specifications/parameters.\\n\\nThe licensee should perform following periodic surveillance activities for their X-ray\\n\\nequipment:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nChecks to ensure electrical safety i.e. earth bonding and electrical insulation of cables; ii. Cleaning/replacing of filters, if any, of cooling system(s); iii. Checks to ensure there is no leakage from the X-ray tube head; iv. Checks to ensure that cables are in good working condition and wires are not\\n\\nfrayed/exposed; Tests on interlocks and emergency cut-out switches;\\n\\nv. vi. Tests on permanently installed radiation detectors inside radiography enclosures; vii. Any other tests and maintenance as recommended by the manufacturer/vendor.\\n\\nThe licensee should establish, maintain and implement a program for maintenance of the equipment. It should be ensured that only manufacturer/vendor or specifically trained operator(s) perform such maintenance. The maintenance should be performed at least once per year or more, if the equipment is used in severe environmental conditions, such as excessive dirt, extreme humidity or is frequently moved within/outside the premises. Non- functioning or damaged parts of the equipment should be replaced at the earliest, whenever necessary. Record(s) of all maintenance activities, including replacement of parts, should be maintained and made available during the inspection(s).\\n\\n8\\n\\nTYPES OF INDUSTRIAL RADIOGRAPHY\\n\\nIndustrial radiography is carried out under a variety of exposure conditions. The radiography, with respect to exposure conditions, is generally classified into two categories i.e. radiography in a shielded enclosure (specially designed exposure room/bunker) and a site radiography (performed in the field or in a client\\'s premises). Owner/Licensee is responsible to ensure protection of workers, public and the environment, in both the exposure situations. In addition to the responsibilities as specified in Section 4.1, following recommendations should also be implemented during both types of radiography activities:\\n\\n8.1 Recommendations for Shielded Enclosure\\n\\n[4,5]\\n\\nA shielded enclosure is an enclosed space specially designed and engineered to provide\\n\\n15\\n\\nadequate shielding against ionizing radiations to the workers and other individuals in the vicinity. The enclosure should be designed to keep all, direct and scattered, radiations arising from radiographic exposures within itself by permitting operation of radiography equipment, from outside, by a remote means (i.e. crank or a control panel). It should incorporate engineering controls to prevent or to minimize the potential exposure of workers who might enter the enclosure when the source(s) (i.e. SRS or an X-ray generator) is exposed or energized. The licensee should ensure that industrial radiography is always performed inside a shielded enclosure, whenever it is reasonably practicable. No one should remain inside the enclosure during exposure. Following precautions should be taken for the radiography performed in a shielded enclosure:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nThe bunker should be constructed in a way that the doors/ports, walls, floor and the ceiling, form a complete shielded enclosure; The shielding should be sufficient to ensure that during exposure; instantaneous dose rate outside the enclosure should be in the range of 2.5 - 20 Sv/hr at one (1) foot from the walls;\\n\\niii. Shielding and the location of enclosure should be such that no worker or a member of public should receive an effective dose in excess of 5 mSv and 1 mSv per year respectively from exposures carried out within it;\\n\\niv. There should be a single access point for the radiography enclosure with a warning notice/sign displayed at it. A warning light should also be provided capable of illuminating during exposure and visible from outside the enclosure; Interlocks should be installed at the access point of the enclosure capable of activating a visible and audible alarm if any interlock is opened/bypassed during the exposure;\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi. Door and panels covering access apertures into the enclosure should overlap with those apertures by a sufficient margin to prevent any leakage of radiations from the enclosure. Where a maze is used for the access, a lockable door or barrier connected to an interlock should be provided;\\n\\nvii. Since, dose rates are very high inside the enclosure, during radiography work, therefore, it should be designated as a controlled area. However, it is not required to be designated as a controlled area when it is not in use;\\n\\nviii. The enclosure should be designed in such a way that there should be no controlled area outside it. However, the area surrounding the shielded enclosure might be designated as a supervised area, if situation warrants.\\n\\n8.2 Recommendations for Site Radiography\\n\\n[4]\\n\\nA great deal of industrial radiography operations are performed without any shielded enclosure due to economy, convenience and practical necessity. Such radiography is called as site radiography. Particular care should be exercised, during site radiography, to avoid unnecessary exposure of workers and individuals in the vicinity and to keep all the exposures as low as reasonably achievable. Collimators should be used to the extent practicable to restrict the radiation beam to the object being radiographed.\\n\\n16\\n\\nThe licensee is responsible to implement following precautions for the radiography\\n\\nperformed in an open site:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nBefore undertaking site/field radiography, appropriate working rules should be established and adhered to at all times;\\n\\nii. A set of site working rules should be available at site and the radiography crew should ensure that they are familiar with such rules that apply to planned exposure situations. Any modifications or additional rules to meet the particular situation should be developed in consultation with the RPO;\\n\\niii. Before commencing radiography in an open site/field, a well-defined and clearly visible boundary should be established using warning signs, barriers, flagged rope, etc. The boundary should be located such that the calculated dose rate at the boundary during exposure should not exceed the regulatory limit of 10 µSv/hr. Actual dose rate at the boundary should be measured during exposure using a survey meter and location of the boundary should be rectified as necessary before subsequent exposures; The boundaries of adjacent sites/fields should not overlap each other. If overlap is unavoidable; close liaison should be maintained between radiography crew responsible for the adjacent sites to avoid accidental exposure; Control panel (or crank) should be placed at such a location that the dose rate remains as low as reasonably achievable. During exposure, the radiographer, whenever possible, should move quickly to a location where the dose rate does not exceed the regulatory limit of 25 µSv/hr. The dose rate at the control panel, if occupied, or at the position taken up by the radiographer during exposure should be checked regularly by using a survey meter; Immediate surroundings of the exposure device should be clearly visible from the control panel and from the position taken up by the radiographer during exposure. The area inside the delineated boundary of an open site/field should be inspected, prior to exposure, to ensure that no worker or an individual is inside it. It should be kept under observation at all the times during exposure to ensure that no one enters into it;\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii. Appropriate warning light(s) and an audible alarm located immediately adjacent to the exposure device should be used to indicate that an exposure is underway; viii. Megaphone should also be made available to warn people in the vicinity not to\\n\\nenter the demarked area.\\n\\n9\\n\\n[1] AREA CLASSIFICATION AND LOCAL RULES\\n\\nAn area in which work involving radiation source(s) is undertaken is called radiation area. It is required to be specifically classified on the bases of potential for exposure to workers and individuals working in that area. It is classified into two types namely; controlled area and supervised area.\\n\\n9.1 Controlled Area\\n\\nThe licensee should make arrangements to designate a radiation area as a controlled area\\n\\n17\\n\\nwhere specific protective measures or safety provisions are required for:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nControlling normal exposures; Preventing or limiting the extent of any potential exposures.\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that the area where there is a likelihood of receiving an effective dose exceeding 6 mSv/year (i.e. 0.69 μSv/hr) or 3/10th of the annual dose limit is designated as a controlled area.\\n\\n9.2 Recommendations for Controlled Area\\n\\nThe licensee is responsible to ensure that followings recommendations are followed by\\n\\nthe radiation workers while working in a controlled area:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nA controlled area should be physically delineated. The radiation warning signs and notices clearly stating “controlled area” should be prominently displayed at all access points; Access to controlled areas should be restricted to authorized persons only. The degree of restriction should be commensurate with the magnitude and likelihood of potential exposures;\\n\\niii. Workplace monitoring should be carried out all around the controlled area. Suitable dose rate monitors (with measuring range from µSv/hr to mSv/hr) should be used for this purpose;\\n\\niv. Arrangements should be made for calibration and testing of radiation monitoring instruments at regular intervals (preferably on annual basis); or as recommended by the Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory (SSDL) or any other certified service provider; Local rules should be strictly followed, at all times, during the work in a controlled area.\\n\\nv.\\n\\n9.3 Supervised Area\\n\\nThe licensee should make arrangements to designate a radiation area as a supervised area where occupational exposure conditions are required to be kept under review. Even though specific protection measures and safety provisions are not normally applied in a supervised area, however, exposure conditions should be kept under review.\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that an area where there is a likelihood of receiving an effective dose exceeding one (1) mSv/year (i.e. 0.11 μSv/hr) or equivalent dose greater than 1/10th of the annual dose limit is designated as a supervised area.\\n\\nUsually, all the delineated areas are controlled areas, rather than a supervised area, in industrial radiography. Supervised areas mostly exist in case of a radiography in a shielded enclosure (room/bunker) rather than the site/field radiography. For example, the area where the control panel is situated outside a shielded enclosure may often be classified as a supervised area.\\n\\n18\\n\\n9.4 Recommendations for Supervised Area\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that followings recommendations are followed by workers\\n\\nwhile working in a supervised area:\\n\\ni. ii. Appropriate radiation warning signs should be posted at all access points; iii.\\n\\nThe extent of supervised area should also be delineated;\\n\\nPeriodic dose-rate monitoring should be carried out in and around the supervised area to ensure that working conditions are kept under review; Established local rules should be followed during the work in a supervised area.\\n\\niv.\\n\\n9.5 Local Rules\\n\\nLocal rules are a set of instructions that specify the manner in which the work should be carried out to ensure adequate level of protection of worker. All industrial radiography work should be carried out in accordance with a set of established local rules. It is responsibility of the licensee to establish local rules and ensure their implementation during radiography work. The licensee should ensure that these local rules describe their organizational structure and the procedures to be followed in a radiation area. These should be set down in writing preferably in local language and should be made available to all the workers involved in radiography. The format and detailed content of local rules may vary among the organizations depending on the type of radiography being undertaken and circumstances of work, however, it should include the following as a minimum:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nIdentification of individual(s) responsible for supervision of work along with their names and designations;\\n\\nii. Description of all controlled and supervised areas. For radiography in a shielded enclosure this may be specific to the premises where the work is carried out. However, for site radiography this may be a general description of conditions under which controlled or supervised areas are considered to exist;\\n\\niii. General radiation safety procedures and instructions on how work should be\\n\\ncarried out in order to keep the exposure minimum;\\n\\niv. Value of dose investigation level (set by the Licensee/RPO) and corresponding\\n\\nv.\\n\\nactions/procedures to be followed in the event of that level being exceede Emergency plan describing actions to be taken in the event of any reasonably foreseeable incident or accident.\\n\\n10 STORAGE OF RADIOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT AND SOURCES\\n\\n[5]\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that the place where the radiography equipment and the\\n\\nsources (i.e. SRS and X-ray generators) are stored, fulfill the following recommendations:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nRadiography equipment should be kept in a room that is not used for any purpose other than for the storage of radiography equipment and its accessories;\\n\\n19\\n\\nii.\\n\\nThe storage room should be constructed with the material of sufficient durability and strength to resist fire and unauthorized entry;\\n\\niii. The dose rate outside the storage room should be as low as reasonably achievable and it should be ensured that dose rate inside it is less than 2.5 μSv/h, or any member of public will not receive dose exceeding one (1) mSv per year; The storage room should be under the control of a responsible person (e.g. RPO) designated by the licensee and should be kept locked except when removing or replacing the radiography equipment and/or sources; The log-book for the issuance of keys should be maintained;\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv. vi. The storage room should have a conspicuous notice bearing the word “CAUTION” and a radiation warning sign indicating that it is storage for radiography equipment and sources;\\n\\nvii. The notice, or a separate but adjacent notice, should contain instructions for\\n\\ncontacting the responsible person (i.e. RPO) in case of an emergency;\\n\\nviii. The storage room should not be located in proximity to explosives, combustible,\\n\\nix.\\n\\ncorrosive materials, or undeveloped photographic films; Physical security of storage room should also be ensured. The storage room should have only one access door, so that it may not be used as a thorough fare.\\n\\n11 TRANSPORT OF RADIOGRAPHY SOURCES\\n\\n[3]\\n\\nThe deliberate physical movement of radioactive material from one place to another is called transport. PNRA Regulations on Transport of Radioactive Material - PAK/916 assign responsibilities to individuals involved in transport of radioactive materials. These individuals include:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nThe consignor (a person or organization that prepares a consignment for transport); The carrier (the person or organization that undertakes transport of radioactive material); and\\n\\niii. The consignee (the person or organization that receives a consignment).\\n\\nIn many cases, for site radiography work, the licensee itself is responsible to perform all\\n\\nthree functions and is required to discharge the responsibilities associated with each function.\\n\\nFor the transportation of a radioactive material (i.e. radiography sources) within or\\n\\noutside the premises, the licensee is responsible to ensure the following:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nRadiation monitoring should be conducted before, during and after the transportation to verify that the source is in a shielded position;\\n\\nii. When radiography sources are to be moved within a site, for radiography work, they should be kept in the storage facility until they are ready to move to a new location. Ancillary equipment should be disconnected from the devices, and all required plugs and caps should be installed prior to movement;\\n\\n20\\n\\niii. The sources should be moved only in packages (i.e. exposure devices), and these should be locked and keys should be removed. If a vehicle or trolley is used to move the package, the package should be stowed or securely fastened to the vehicle or trolley so as to prevent any shift under any transport incident. The exposure devices should be kept under surveillance for the duration of movement on work location;\\n\\niv. When sources are to be transported to another work location, for the purpose of site radiography, they should be kept in a designated storage facility until they are moved to a new location. All ancillary equipment should be disconnected and all required plugs and caps should be installed prior to transport; The licensee should ensure that the transport and the transport packages comply with the requirements of PAK/916. Where applicable, binding international instruments (i.e. codes and standards) for specific modes of transport e.g. by air or sea, should also be considered;\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi. The package containing radiography source should be placed in a vehicle in such a way that the maximum dose rate for any person traveling in the vehicle shall not exceed 20 µSv/h;\\n\\nvii. The compartment where such package is stowed should be locked and it should not be left unattended, if placed in the back of an open vehicle, at any time during the transport;\\n\\nviii. Special arrangements for security of radiography sources, during transport,\\n\\nshould also be made.\\n\\n11.1 Actions Following Loss of or Damage to a Package During Transport\\n\\nIf the package containing a radiography source is damaged or appears to be damaged\\n\\nduring transport, the licensee/owner should immediately take following actions:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nPerson(s) responsible for safety/security of the package, at the time of incident/accident, should notify the licensee/owner and the RPO about the incident/accident; The licensee/owner and/or the RPO should ensure that the package is carefully examined to verify that it continues to comply with transport requirements. Radiation survey should be carried out to ensure that the radiation levels at a distance of five (5) cm, at the surface and at one (1) meter from the surface of the package are within acceptable range (i.e. category of package). In case if levels are exceeded, then the established emergency procedures should be followed [2]; If package is lost or theft during transport, the person(s) responsible for its safety/security should notify the licensee/owner and the RPO, and provide all relevant information that could facilitate an early recovery of the package.\\n\\n12 ACCOUNTABILITY OF RADIOGRAPHY SOURCES\\n\\n[1]\\n\\nLicensee should make necessary arrangements for the safety and security of the radiography sources (i.e. SRS and X-ray generators) so as to prevent the loss, theft, damage\\n\\n21\\n\\nand any unauthorized transfer or access to the sources. An accountability system, for such sources, should be established and maintained.\\n\\nFormal record containing the following information about the sources, wherever\\n\\napplicable, should be retained:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nName, identification/serial number, physical form and activity of sources with reference date (for SRS only);\\n\\nii. Maximum tube potential difference (kV) and current (mA), or maximum X-ray\\n\\nenergy (keV) and maximum output (dose rate);\\n\\niii. Manufacturer, model and identification number of exposure device(s)/package(s)\\n\\nand/or X-ray generator(s);\\n\\niv. Total number of sources in the custody including in use/disused SRS; v.\\n\\nLog for issuance and receipt of sources along with name of responsible person with dates;\\n\\nvi. Location of radiography work/site for which the source was issued; vii. Detail of disposed sources including date and method of disposal.\\n\\nThrough such accountability, the licensee should ensure that the locations of radiography sources are known at all times and losses are quickly identified and recovered. The record should always be kept updated and should be made available for verification during regulatory inspections. An updated inventory sheet of the sources should be submitted to the Authority biannually or earlier, if so desired by the Authority.\\n\\n13 LEAK TESTING\\n\\nThe purpose of leak testing is to ensure that the sealed radioactive sources remain intact and that there is no leakage or dispersal of radioactive material from the housing/casing of the source. Radiography sources (i.e. SRS only) should be “leak tested” at regular intervals as specified by the Authority. It should be noted that the frequency of the leak test ranges from biannually to once in several years. For instance, typical Cobalt-60 sources of activity greater than 370 GBq (10 Ci) are leak tested at every six (6) or twelve (12) months interval. Whereas, Iridium-192 sources are not normally leak tested because of their short half lives, they are typically disused within a year.\\n\\n14 EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\\n\\n[4]\\n\\nEver increasing application of ionizing radiation in industrial radiography requires having emergency preparedness and response arrangements in place to cater for the potential radiation emergencies associated with it. In industrial radiography, accidents/incidents may result in undue exposure of workers and members of the public. PNRA regulations PAK/914 requires the licensee to develop radiation emergency plan to be implemented during the course of an emergency. The purpose of such emergency planning is to control/restrict undue exposures As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP).\\n\\nThe concept of emergency preparedness and response is based on following major\\n\\n22\\n\\ncomponents:\\n\\ni. ii. iii. Acquisition of emergency equipment iv. v. vi.\\n\\nAssessment of hazards Preparation of emergency plan and procedure(s)\\n\\nConduct of training drills/exercises Periodic review of emergency plan and equipment Incident reporting\\n\\n14.1 Assessment of Hazards\\n\\nEmergency planning starts with an assessment of hazard which involves analysis of normal operating conditions, foreseeable abnormal conditions (such as equipment malfunction/failure, fire, flood, earthquake etc.), all possible types of accidents/incidents and their anticipated consequences. Experience feedback and analysis of past accidents/incidents in industrial radiography shows that most likely events involving radiography devices include, but not limited to, the following:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nFailure of radiographer to retract the radiography source and/or to perform pre/post job area survey Stuck of source in the guide tube, collimator or near the entrance of the exposure container\\n\\niii. Malfunctioning or defect in the safety control system iv. v. vi. vii. Handling/recovery of lost/stolen radiography source viii. Damage of radiography source container ix. Accident during transport of radiography source\\n\\nEntry of personnel into the controlled area during the exposure Un-intentionally energizing the X-ray machine Spread of contamination due to leaked or damaged radiography source(s)\\n\\nAll of the events enlisted above usually involve higher dose(s), in access of the prescribed dose limits, that may cause localized exposure resulting in severe radiation injury(ies).\\n\\n14.2 Preparation of Radiation Emergency Plan and Procedure(s)\\n\\nLicensee is responsible to prepare its radiation emergency plan and necessary implementing procedure(s) to cater for all the foreseeable types of incidents/emergencies. It should be concise and include a description of situations requiring emergency response actions. In particular, it should specify immediate actions to be taken, to minimize radiation exposure to individuals, in the vicinity of the source/incident.The implementing procedure(s) should describe the name(s) of the response officials, their contact details and means of communication during on and off working hours. The list of individuals/organizations having a role in implementation of the emergency response plan may include the following:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nRadiation Protection Officer (RPO)\\n\\n23\\n\\nŸ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ\\n\\nQualified Expert PNRA (NRECC/Relevant RNSD) Medical Doctor Local Administration Emergency Services (Rescue 1122, Fire Fighting, Local Police, etc.) Security Incharge of the Facility\\n\\nThe licensee should provide the copy of its approved radiation emergency plan and its\\n\\nimplementing procedures to all relevant stakeholders.\\n\\n14.3 Acquisition of Emergency Equipment\\n\\nThe licensee of an industrial radiography facility should acquire/posses sufficient equipment to adequately respond to any anticipated emergency situation. This list of necessary emergency equipment may vary, however, it is likely to include the items as given in the table below:\\n\\nTable: List of Emergency Equipment\\n\\nSr. No.\\n\\nType\\n\\nItems\\n\\n1.\\n\\nRadiation Monitoring Instruments\\n\\nŸ High-Range Survey Meter (RID) Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD) Ÿ Ÿ Radionuclide Identification Device (RID)\\n\\n2.\\n\\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\\n\\nŸ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ\\n\\nProtective Clothing Lead Shots/ Bricks Long Tongs Lead Goggles/ Gloves Shielded Container\\n\\n3.\\n\\nCommunication Equipment\\n\\nŸ Walkie-Talkie Ÿ Mobile Phones\\n\\n4.\\n\\nSupplies\\n\\nŸ Radiation Warning Signs Ÿ Barricading Tape Ÿ Mega Phone\\n\\nIn addition to the written and approved emergency plan; any supporting documents e.g.\\n\\nequipment operation manuals, etc. may also be included with the emergency equipment.\\n\\n14.4 Conduct of Training Drills/Exercises\\n\\nIn order to develop the capabilities required to implement radiation emergency plan, the licensee should train its staff to deal with the identified emergency situation(s). This training may include handling of emergency equipment and implementation of radiation emergency plan and its implementing procedure(s). Once this response capability is developed, specific drills and full scope emergency exercises should be conducted periodically (preferably once in a year). Such exercises not only help in providing training to emergency response workers but also test and validate the approved radiation emergency plan of the facility. The schedule of these emergency drills/exercises should be communicated to the Authority, well in advance, so that the Authority may witness the conduct of such drills/exercises.\\n\\n24\\n\\n14.5 Periodic Review of Emergency Plan and Equipment\\n\\nThe licensee should conduct formal review of emergency plan and implementing\\n\\nprocedure(s) annually to ensure that:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nAll responsible persons within the facility and relevant off-site organizations whose role is anticipated during response to a radiological emergency have been identified and their relevant contact details (i.e. telephone numbers and fax numbers) are up to date; Emergency equipment (as enlisted in Section 14.3) is readily available and is maintained in operable condition.\\n\\nSuch periodic reviews should take into account the lessons learnt from drills/exercises or in response to actual incidents/emergencies and should form the basis for revision/updation of emergency response plan and/or its implementing procedures.\\n\\n14.6 Incident Reporting\\n\\nThe licensee should notify any incident involving radiation source and warranting emergency response actions to the Authority through incident reporting performa. Such notifications should be followed up by a detailed written incident report that should include the following:\\n\\ni. ii. Actions taken to mitigate the situation, to regain the control and to restore the\\n\\nDescription of incident/emergency;\\n\\nconditions to normal; iii. Root cause of the accident; iv. v. vi. Lessons learnt/ experience feedback; vii. Recommendations/ corrective actions.\\n\\nTraining and experience of the personnel involved; Assessment of exposures (of the personnel involved);\\n\\nThe incident/emergency reports should be prepared by the RPO and approved by the\\n\\nmanagement, before submitting to the Authority.\\n\\n15 REFERENCES\\n\\n1. 2.\\n\\n3. 4.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nRegulations on Radiation Protection - PAK/904 Regulations on Management of a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency - PAK/914 (Rev.0) Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material - PAK/916 Radiation Safety in Industrial Radiography, Specific Safety Guide No. SSG-11, IAEA, 2011 Code of Practice for the Safe Use of Industrial Radiography Equipment, Radiation Health Series No. 31, National Health and Medical Research Council, Canberra, Australia, 1989\\n\\n25\\n\\nGLOSSARY\\n\\n(a) \"Absorbed Dose\" is a measure of energy that is deposited in a material per unit mass from any interaction with radiation.

This guide will be useful in implementation of regulatory requirements set under Section - 28(1) of PNRA regulations on radiation protection (PAK/904) and international safety standards set by ICRP through its Publication - 103. The effective implementation of these requirements would help to ensure protection of radiation workers, public, environment and patients from harmful effects of radiation.\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nRadio-iodine (I-131) is a gamma emitter which is used for diagnosis and treatment of thyroid carcinoma or hyperthyroidism. It is generally administered orally in liquid form in Pakistan. However, it is also available in capsule or caplet form in all over the world. Radiation dose to be administered to the patient for treatment of tumor is prescribed by a nuclear physician and it depends on many factors including tumor size, its location and staging etc.\\n\\nI-131 has been widely used in Nuclear Medicine Centers and its applications are largely beneficial for thyroid patients. The prime safety concern in the use of radioisotopes is that the patients, radiation workers and general public are not exposed to unnecessary radiation which is harmful to their health. While dealing with patients administered with I-131, all possible efforts should be made to minimize radiation exposure of the workers directly involved in administrating I-131 to the patients and to other workers and general public in and around the facility.\\n\\nThis guide is issued under the provisions of section-28(1) of PNRA “Regulations on Radiation Protection” - PAK/904 [1]. It mainly addresses various safety measures which are required to be taken during planning, designing and construction of radio-iodine facility. It also focuses on arrangements for handling and storage of radio-iodine, dose administration, actions to be taken in case of its spillage, decontamination procedure, storage of generated waste, visitors access control and radiation protection program of a facility.\\n\\n2\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance for protection of patients, radiation workers, general public, and the environment from undue exposure and harmful effects of I-131.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThis regulatory guide contains guidance on radiation safety, handling, usage and storage of I-131 and is mainly applicable to the nuclear medicine centers involved in diagnostic and therapeutic use of radio-iodine. The guide may also be used by the personnel involved in production of radio-iodine for medical and other industrial applications.\\n\\n4\\n\\nPRE-REQUISITES FOR PLANNING OF RADIO-IODINE FACILITY\\n\\nProper planning of the facility ensures more efficient radiation protection and easier supervision. The design of the facility should always allow for modifications and extension to meet future needs. Radio-Iodine facilities serve as clinical department of the hospital and preferably should be located such that the access of unauthorized personnel is controlled. Common use of other facilities of Nuclear Medicine Department (such as dispensing room, measurement room, storage room, radioactive waste disposal/storage room, and radiation\\n\\n2\\n\\nprotection arrangements etc.) reasonably reduces the costs of construction and number of personnel required.\\n\\nAt planning stage, the radio-iodine facility should generally be categorized into\\n\\nfollowing four groups:\\n\\ni. Laboratories and premises not frequented by patients, including rooms for the\\n\\nstorage, preparation, and dispensing of radio-iodine (controlled area).\\n\\nii. Premises frequented by patients, including rooms for administration of radio-iodine\\n\\nand for carrying out measurements on patients (controlled area). iii. Storage places for radioactive waste materials (controlled area). iv. Offices for doctors and other facility personnel (supervised area).\\n\\n4.1 Design Consideration for Facility\\n\\nGamma emitters are commonly used in Nuclear Medicine Departments; therefore, the background radiation is generally elevated. Radiation workers are exposed not only to the radiation received in nursing or dispensing the patients with radiopharmaceuticals in the laboratory but also to the continuous background radiation. Following recommendations should be considered in planning the radio-iodine facility to minimize the occupational exposure:\\n\\ni. Unnecessary radiation exposures should be avoided. ii. Radiation dose received by the radiation worker should not exceed his annual dose\\n\\nlimit of 20 mSv/year, as prescribed in PAK/904.\\n\\nAn effort should be made to ensure that the exposure received by a radiation worker remaining continually in a radiation room should be as low as reasonably possible. If the exposure of a radiation worker approaches to maximum annual limit of a radiation worker, then he may not be allowed to continue work in radiation environment for the remaining year. In addition, Section 27 of PNRA regulations on radiation protection (PAK/904) and Publication 103 of International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [2] recommend following conditions of work with respect to radiations:\\n\\na. Conditions such that the resulting (effective) dose might exceed 3/10th of the annual\\n\\ndose limit of radiation worker (Controlled Area).\\n\\nb. Conditions such that the resulting (effective) dose is most unlikely to exceed 3/10th\\n\\nof the annual dose limit of radiation worker (Supervised Area).\\n\\nAn important practical implication is that; under condition (a), the dose assessment of a radiation worker is usually based on individual monitoring for external radiations or internal contamination as appropriate; whereas under condition (b), workers may not require individual monitoring or special health supervision and it is sufficient in some cases to rely on area\\n\\n3\\n\\nmonitoring. If these factors are considered at planning stage, the initial design cost of the facility may increase, however, running cost of the facility which incur on account of dose monitoring, health surveillance , and provision of shielding equipments is reasonably reduced which in-turn compensate for initial design cost.\\n\\nIt is recommended that planning and construction should be carried out on the basis of assumption that there would be no area within the facility where the radiation workers can receive more than 10% of his average weekly dose limit i.e. the dose should not exceed 100 µSv/week. As a result, the average dose will not be greater than 2 µSv/h in a working week of about 50 hours (as is often the case in hospitals).\\n\\nThe radiation detection and measuring equipment used in the diagnostic measurement rooms is usually very sensitive and may require extra shielding. Therefore, the background radiation level in such locations should be as low as that in the normal rooms e.g. about 0.1 µGray/h.\\n\\n4.2 General Recommendations\\n\\nA standard Radio-Iodine Facility/Nuclear Medicine Center should have following features:\\n\\n2\\n\\ni. All rooms should be spacious i.e. having about 10m floor area [3]. ii. The radio-pharmacy should be tidy and separate benches should be used for\\n\\ndispensing.\\n\\niii. Separate areas/rooms should be designated for patients and staff. iv. Warning signs and instructions for visitors (particularly for pregnant women) should be prominently displayed in waiting area for the patients to whom radio-iodine is to be administered.\\n\\nv. Radiation warning signs and instructions should also be displayed in storage areas\\n\\nand dispensing rooms.\\n\\nvi. Isolation rooms should be available for admission of patients to whom therapeutic\\n\\ndose of radio-iodine is administered.\\n\\nvii. Radioactive waste collection bins should be available in hot lab, dispensing room and\\n\\npatient\\'s isolation rooms.\\n\\nviii.Appropriate shielding devices should be provided for nursing staff and comforters\\n\\nentering the isolation rooms.\\n\\nix. Bench tops, floors and patient toilets should be easy to wash and decontaminate. x. All relevant records should be prepared and maintained in an auditable form.\\n\\n4.3 Design of Radioisotope Laboratory (Hot Lab)\\n\\nRadioisotope Laboratory or Hot Lab is the most important place within the facility. Since\\n\\n4\\n\\nlarge activity of Iodine-131 is handled here, therefore, a trained technician should be available to handle radiopharmaceuticals under the supervision of a qualified Medical Physicist/ Radiation Protection Officer (RPO). Following important points should be taken into consideration while designing a radioisotope laboratory or hot lab:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nThe radioisotope laboratory should be separate from other laboratories/places. Special attention should be given during the planning for ventilation, drains, fume hood, laminar airflow cabinet, disposal of waste and shielding requirement such that; Ÿ The ventilation of fume hoods should never be connected with the ventilation system of the building and the exhaust air should be released through charcoal filter and a straight corrosion-resistant tube at about 2 m above the roof.\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv. v. vi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nThe radioisotopes should be placed in shielded containers so that the background radiation level can be maintained as low as that in normal rooms (about 0.1µSv/h) [3]. Building expansion joints should not pass through the laboratory. The seating arrangement should allow ready escape in case of an emergency. Surface finishes to the walls, ceilings and furniture in the laboratory should be chosen so that they can be easily cleaned. Floors should be made non-slip. Floor covering should be impermeable with welded joints and be coved against the walls for ease of decontamination. Rubber, Vinyl, or Asphalt tiles used in the floor have the advantage that these can readily be removed by replacing a few tiles, if contaminated.\\n\\nviii. Cupboards used to store radioisotopes should be lockable; provided with metal\\n\\ntrays to contain spill and protect against fire.\\n\\nix. All hazards involved in the work should be considered such as radioactive\\n\\nx.\\n\\ncontamination, fire, mechanical, electrical, chemical and biological hazards etc. The entrance to hot lab should display a radiation warning sign and a text indicating \"entrance is restricted to authorized persons only\".\\n\\nxi. Hot Lab should be of sufficient size and separate work surfaces for handling\\n\\nxii.\\n\\nradioisotopes and office work should be provided. If dispensing room is part of the laboratory, this area should be segregated from the rest of the area, with no thorough passage. It should not be adjacent to film storage area or areas where low-level measurements are performed.\\n\\nxiii. Wor should be performed over absorbent surfaces; bench paper or spill trays\\n\\nshould be plastic-backed to prevent spread of contamination.\\n\\nxiv. Wash basins, provided with automated or elbow operated water taps, should be\\n\\nxv.\\n\\ninstalled. Sources of gamma or high-energy beta radiation should be handled using screen of lead glass or lead Perspex to protect the radiation worker.\\n\\n5\\n\\nxvi. The vials containing radiopharmaceuticals should be placed in a fume hood to avoid airborne contamination and be stored away from high-occupancy areas of the laboratory.\\n\\nxvii. Cupboards or enclosed storage areas that are used for holding\\n\\nradiopharmaceuticals should be well shielded.\\n\\nxviii. If significant quantities of liquid waste are to be disposed off into the sewerage system, disposal should preferably be attached with delay tanks. Otherwise, dilution and dispersion method should be opted.\\n\\nxix. Pedal-operated shielded buckets, reserved for radioactive waste only, labeled with\\n\\nradiation symbol should be provided in the hot lab [3].\\n\\nxx. After completing the work with radiopharmaceuticals, workers should wash their hands and monitor their hands and shoes for the presence of any contamination.\\n\\n4.4 Design of Dispensing Room\\n\\nFollowing recommendations should be taken into consideration while designing the dispensing room:\\n\\ni. The room should be of 8-10m2 area having a non-slip waterproof floor finish\\n\\nextending up to the walls to a height of about 10 cm [3].\\n\\nii. The floor covering should be impermeable with welded joints and be coved against the walls for ease of decontamination. Preference should be given to Rubber, Vinyl, or Asphalt tiles which have the advantage that these can readily be removed by replacing a few tiles, if contaminated.\\n\\niii. Wash basins for washing hands should be provided along with a hand monitor to\\n\\nensure that the staff has no contamination.\\n\\niv. Dispensing room should only be used for dispensing of radiopharmaceuticals for\\n\\ndiagnostic and therapeutic purposes.\\n\\nv. Pedal-operated shielded buckets, reserved for radioactive waste only, labeled with\\n\\nradiation symbol should be provided in the dispensing room.\\n\\n4.5 Design of Isolation Room\\n\\nFollowing points should be taken into account while designing the isolation rooms:\\n\\ni. An isolation room should have an attached toilet and shower facility. ii. The bed should be located as remotely as possible from the entrance door and portable shielding screens should be used by the staff while visiting the patient\\'s room.\\n\\niii. Floor, walls and furniture surfaces should be smooth, continuous and impermeable\\n\\nfor ease of decontamination.\\n\\niv. Warning signs and instructions should be displayed outside the room door for\\n\\n6\\n\\nawareness of the visitors/comforters.\\n\\n4.6 Storage and Disposal of Radioactive Waste\\n\\nRadioactive waste should be disposed off in a manner that all regulatory requirements as specified in PNRA regulations on radioactive waste management - PAK/915 [4] are met. Solid radioactive waste should be collected and stored in shielded bins available in the area where it is generated prior to disposal. Liquid radioactive waste should be collected in delay tanks and not to be discharged in ordinary sewerage for disposal (except for patient excreta) unless authorized by RPO after ensuring that there is no radiation risk to the environment. General guidelines for handling and disposal of radioactive waste are outlined below.\\n\\ni. ii. iii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv. vi.\\n\\nVolume of solid waste should be kept as small as possible. A separate room for interim storage of radioactive waste should be available. The room should be locked, ventilated and properly marked with instructions and radiation warning signs. Radioactive waste (vials, syringes, bags, etc) should be segregated and should be collected in separate containers properly labeled providing information about the radionuclide, its activity and concentration etc. Flammable material should not be kept inside the radioactive waste storage room. Lids of radioactive waste bins and containers should be securely placed at all times even when the containers are not in use.\\n\\nvii. Radioactive waste containing infectious material should be treated to render it non-\\n\\ninfectious prior to disposal.\\n\\nviii. Record should be maintained in a retrievable manner which includes the date of disposal, model and serial number of survey instrument used, the background radiation level, dose rate measured at the surface of each waste container, and the name of individual who performed the disposal.\\n\\nix. Generated radioactive waste should be stored for the purpose of delay and decay for a minimum period of 6 months prior to its final disposal (irrespective of its activity and half life) and relevant records should be retained for 3 years.\\n\\n4.7 Warning Signs and Labels\\n\\nRadiation warning signs and instructions should be displayed prominently outside the radiation area. These instructions should indicate possible radiation risk and dose level that may be present in the area. Magenta or black on a yellow background trefoil warning sign should be used to indicate the presence of ionizing radiations.\\n\\n5\\n\\nPROCEDURE FOR HANDLING RADIO-IODINE\\n\\nThe following procedures should be adopted in all cases where radioiodine is being\\n\\nhandled.\\n\\n7\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nThe radioiodine should always be stored in a shielded container placed in a controlled area. The lead container should be of 1-3 cm thickness to ensure minimum dose rate at external surface of the container [3].\\n\\niii. Vials containing radio-iodine should always be handled in the fume hood. iv.\\n\\nReceptacles, fabrics, clothing, handkerchiefs etc., likely to become contaminated should be of disposable nature, whenever practicable. All items known or suspected to be contaminated should be stored in containers, which can be readily decontaminated or disposed off. Such items should be disposed off under the supervision of RPO to ensure the level of contamination is below the exemption level.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi. All items of non-disposable nature should be checked under the supervision of RPO to determine the level of contamination before and after decontamination, and returned to routine use when declared to be clear by the RPO.\\n\\nvii. Nursing staff carrying out procedures which may result in contamination of skin and/or clothing should wear protective gloves and gowns. Their hands and clothing should be monitored after completion of work and if necessary, decontamination should be performed under the supervision of RPO, without any delay.\\n\\nviii. Catheterization should be considered when the patient is, or likely to be, incontinent or otherwise incapacitated, to avoid spread of contamination over his clothes, bedding or floor.\\n\\nix. Nappies of infant inpatients administered with radio-iodine should be changed frequently and the used ones, properly sealed in thick plastic bags, should be disposed off/ stored for decay. The ideal method for hospitalized patients, administered with greater than 30mCi radio-iodine, is the use of special toilet suite connected to delay-and-decay tanks. However, the patient, who is administered with less than 30mCi should use an ordinary toilet which has been reserved solely for that patient\\'s use during treatment.\\n\\nx.\\n\\nSpecial precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of spill of radioactive body fluids e.g. vomit, blood, urine and feces etc. Instructions should be given by RPO to take appropriate action in the event of a spill of radioactive body fluid. These instructions should be prepared based on following detail regarding minor and major spill of radioactive fluids:\\n\\n5.1 Minor Spills\\n\\nMinor spills include typically less than 100 times exempted quantities of radionuclides mentioned in ANNEX-I of PNRA regulations on radiation protection (PAK/904). In case of a\\n\\n8\\n\\nminor spill, following procedural steps should be followed:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nInform persons in the affected area that a spill has occurred. Keep them away from the contaminated place. Clean up the spill by wearing protective clothing and disposable gloves, using absorbent paper and place it in a plastic bag for transfer to a labeled waste container.\\n\\niii. Work from outside of the spill towards the centre to avoid spreading of\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv. vi.\\n\\ncontamination. Carry out wipe test or survey for residual contamination as appropriate. Repeat decontamination, if necessary, until surface contamination monitoring results reach the dose rate less than 0.02mR/h (0.2 µSv/h) [8]. Check hands, clothing, and shoes for presence of contamination, if any. Report the spill and decontamination results to the person incharge and, if necessary, to the RPO.\\n\\nvii. Record necessary details regarding spill and decontamination results. Update the\\n\\nradionuclide\\'s inventory and waste records accordingly.\\n\\n5.2 Major Spills\\n\\nMajor spills involve more than 100 times of exempted quantities of radionuclides or contamination of personnel or release of volatile radioactive material. In case of major spills, following procedural steps should be followed:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii. iii.\\n\\nImmediately evacuate and cordon off the spill area and post warning sign(s) to prevent further entry of personnel. Notify the RPO or person in-charge immediately. The RPO should take decision for carrying out decontamination of affected area, personnel and necessary cleanup operations.\\n\\niv. Decontaminate personnel by removing their contaminated clothing and flushing\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\ncontaminated part of skin with lukewarm water and mild soap. Follow the decontamination procedures as prescribed earlier for minor spills and repeat if necessary until contamination monitoring results approaches the dose rate value of less than 0.02mR/h (0.2 µSv/h) [8]. If the spill occurs in a laboratory, leave the fume hood running to minimize the release of volatile radionuclides to adjacent rooms and hallways.\\n\\nvii. Record the names of persons involved in handling the spill and conducting\\n\\nnecessary recovery operations.\\n\\nviii. All the persons involved should be monitored for contamination before leaving the\\n\\nix.\\n\\nspillage area. The RPO should arrange for any bioassay measurements, if necessary.\\n\\n9\\n\\nx.\\n\\nThe RPO should submit a detailed report to PNRA within two months of the incident.\\n\\n6\\n\\nDOSE ADMINISTRATION\\n\\nThere are different methodologies for dose administration that are adopted worldwide. Usually therapeutic dose of I-131 is administered in a single dose/fraction having activity about 5550MBq or in multiple doses/fractions of activity 1110MBq per fraction. The patient, to whom more than 1110MBq of I-131 is administered, should be hospitalized and should not be discharged until the activity is less than 1110MBq and the measured dose rate at one meter from the patient is less than 20-50µSv/h (as a good practice). Moreover, if patient-specific calculations demonstrate that potential total effective dose to any individual around him would not be greater than 5mSv then he may be discharged from the hospital with specific set of instructions .\\n\\nOn a specified time, the vial containing radio-iodine which is to be administered is brought on a cart to the patient\\'s room in its shielded shipping container according to the transport requirements as specified in PNRA regulations for the safe transport of radioactive material - PAK/916 [6]. Before dose administration, the nursing staff must ensure that all aspects of therapy have been explained to the patient and that the patient has signed the therapy consent form. Once this has been confirmed, the dose can be administered. All contamination precautions must now be observed. The nursing staff or any other individual entering the isolation room should wear necessary protective clothing which include; 2 pairs of shoe covers, 2 pairs of disposable gloves, surgical gown, a mask and optional hair cover.\\n\\nGreater care must be exercised while administering the radio-iodine dose. Plastic-lined absorbent pads should be used to cover the dosing table and those areas of patient\\'s body that may be subjected to any potential spillage. The vial must remain in its shielded container during administration and a straw should be provided to the patient to drink the radionuclide contents. Once the dose is administered, the nursing staff should wrap the shielded dose vial, straw, and any other possibly contaminated items in the absorbent pads and remove them from the room. The dose vial should be assayed promptly to determine the residual activity so that the actual administered activity could be calculated. This determination of administered activity can be used in conjunction with daily exposure rate measurements to determine the activity remaining in the patient\\'s body. An expression to determine the activity remaining in the patient\\'s body based on exposure rates is given below:\\n\\nActivity Administered = (Total Activity Residual Activity) MBq\\n\\n\\n\\nRemaining Activity =\\n\\nNew Exposure Rate\\n\\nInitial Exposure Rate\\n\\nx\\n\\nAdministered Activity\\n\\n10\\n\\n6.1 Precautionary Measures after Dose Administration\\n\\nFollowing precautionary measures should be followed after the administration of radio-\\n\\niodine dose to the patient [7]:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nNursing staff should be trained and strict compliance of radiation protection requirements must be ensured by the licensee. Once the patient is admitted in the isolation room after administration of radio- iodine dose, nurse in-charge should inform him about any expected cause of contamination and duration of its persistence.\\n\\niii. Door of the isolation room should be kept closed when the patient is admitted. iv.\\n\\nContainers should be provided for temporary storage of used utensils and linen, before they are checked for contamination. The patient should be instructed to attend the collection of excreta preferably himself and hand it over to the nursing staff.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi. When prolonged nursing care is necessary, it should be so divided among the ward staff that the dose received by each individual during his shift is kept to a minimum.\\n\\n7\\n\\nDECONTAMINATION\\n\\nContamination occurs when a radionuclide spreads beyond its normal place of confinement. The radionuclide thus spread may contaminate the environment (air, water, floors, and surfaces in general) and become partly fixed. It may eventually affect human beings internally or externally by exposing them to the radiations being emitted. The external contamination may involve; personnel, clothing and bedding, laboratory equipment and instruments, working surfaces and other surfaces in the room. Every nuclear medicine centre handling radio-iodine should establish decontamination team composed of personnel specially trained in decontamination techniques and possessing all necessary equipment and chemicals required for decontamination.\\n\\n7.1 Decontamination of Personnel\\n\\nRadio-iodine can affect persons who handle it or those who come in contact with the patients carrying radio-iodine (through vomiting, discharges associated with injections, contaminated bed linen, and excreta). It takes the form of contamination on the hands or other areas of the skin or scalp.\\n\\nRadiation exposure to the skin considerably increases when the skin is externally contaminated. Moreover, internal contamination increases if radio-iodine passes through open wounds. If contamination monitor detects contamination of hands or skin, the radioactivity can be reduced below the detection level by carefully washing the skin with soap. Ordinary soap has proved to be the best decontaminant in the event of skin contamination. If the contamination persists, decontamination should be repeated by a decontamination team. One\\n\\n11\\n\\ncan try to reduce the radioactivity by washing the skin with an entraining agent (A detergent ointment with a titanium dioxide base/or saturated potassium permanganate solution). Chemical treatments of this kind should be applied with care in order not to damage the skin, and the same is true for the use of light abrasives and scrubbing agents. Every nuclear medicine center should be equipped with eye-cups and shower facility in the vicinity of change room.\\n\\n7.2 Decontamination of Clothing and Bedding\\n\\nIn nuclear medicine centers/hospitals, clothing and bedding usually become contaminated by perspiration, discharges following injections, incontinence of a patient, vomiting, or due to some other reasons. It is important to change the contaminated clothing and bedding immediately and to seal and store them in polythene bags until they can be sent to laundry.\\n\\nContaminated clothing carries the risk of irradiation of skin and the hazard of internal exposure, if radio-iodine is inhaled or ingested. It can easily be detected with portable contamination monitors. Contaminated clothes and bedding or linen should be washed in a special laundry so as to avoid the washing of contaminated and non contaminated clothing together. Either soap or a detergent can be used for washing.\\n\\nThe operation is preceded and followed by extensive rinsing. A hot 1% Citric Acid solution can also be used. Highly contaminated clothing or linen can be stored for a while to allow the short-lived radionuclides to decay. If contamination with long-lived radioisotopes cannot be removed by laundering, the linen should be treated as radioactive waste. After laundering, clothing should be monitored for residual contamination. Residual levels should be within the limits specified in ANNEX-I of PAK/904.\\n\\n7.3 Decontamination of Equipment and Apparatus\\n\\nThe contamination of equipment such as glassware and minor laboratory tools is highly undesirable as it may lead to contamination of the staff and may also be a source of errors in analyses and measurements. The degree of contamination of laboratory equipment and apparatus is often difficult to determine with accuracy. All parts of equipment/instrument should be assumed as contaminated, prior to conducting decontamination activity.\\n\\nAfter use, porcelain and glassware should be cleaned with appropriate detergents or chemical decontaminants. Chromic Acid cleaning mixture (K Cr 0 + H S0 ) is most commonly used chemical decontaminant. Other chemical agents such as Ammonium Citrate [(NH ) C H O ], Penta-sodium Tri-phosphate (Na P O ) and Ammonium Fluoride (NH HF ) can also be used. Metal objects should first be cleaned with good detergents; if contamination persists then complexing agents (Acitrate-Edetic Acid mixture), Ammonium Fluoride, or dilute acid solutions may be used. Ordinary metal cleaners are usually used to clean stainless steel equipment/instrument. If contamination still persists, a mild abrasive such as a mixture of\\n\\n7\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n6\\n\\n4 3\\n\\n10\\n\\n3\\n\\n5\\n\\n7\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n12\\n\\nNitric Acid and 1% Sodium Fluoride can be employed.\\n\\nIf above methods prove inadequate, one can resort to sand-blasting and/or ultrasonic techniques. The choice of method depends primarily on the type of equipment and whether or not it can withstand the treatment which might lead to the loss of material. If the contaminant is a short-lived radionuclide, the equipment/instrument which proves difficult to decontaminate must be stored until the radioactivity has decayed; otherwise it must be disposed off as a radioactive waste.\\n\\n7.4 Decontamination of Surfaces and Floors\\n\\nContamination of working surfaces, floors, and corridors may originate from spills, settling of aerosols present in the air and the transfer of contamination through shoes. It may also result from an incident involving contamination such as overturning of radioactive solutions or substances and vomiting etc. The result of such incident may be the contamination of surfaces, floors, skin, clothing and bedding. The contaminating material may also form a suspension in the air and lead to internal exposure if inhaled.\\n\\nWorking surfaces and floors should be periodically checked for contamination and should be decontaminated whenever the levels exceed allowable limits. The cleaning-up operation should usually be carried out by sweeping the surface with a broom or brush wetted with a suitable agent, or by mopping it with a damp cloth. Dry sweeping should always be avoided as it may result into the contamination becoming airborne. Linoleum-covered or painted floors should be decontaminated by means of detergents, care being taken to avoid the spreading of contamination. If contamination persists, the floor coverings or paint must be removed.\\n\\nWhen a radioactive solution is spilt, the first step is to prevent the contamination from spreading. The liquid should be covered with sawdust, absorbent material or dry rags immediately. Decontamination can be carried out by mopping the surface with a damp cloth, by ordinary washing, or by scrubbing. If a patient vomits within five hours of administrating radio-iodine dose, all affected floors, bedding, linen, and persons around him must undergo same decontamination procedures as are applied in the event of spillage of radio-iodine.\\n\\n7.5 Wipe Test\\n\\nWipe tests are used to determine the amount and level of contamination present in the affected area, however, it does not measure the entire contamination that is present. The procedure followed for wipe test consists of the following steps:\\n\\ni. ii. Wipe the filter paper or a cotton swab of appropriate size across the affected area.\\n\\nPut on disposable gloves.\\n\\nDry wipes should preferably be used.\\n\\n13\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nFor determination of contamination on the surface of a package, an area of 300 cm2 should be wiped. For determination of contamination on a working surface or a floor, an area of 100 cm2 should be wiped. Take the activity counts of a background sample and the test sample using a well shape counter with Sodium Iodide (NaI) detector. Compare this reading with the applicable threshold levels; carryout the decontamination procedure, if it exceeds the applicable threshold level.\\n\\n8\\n\\nCONTROL OF VISITORS\\n\\nThe management of the facility is responsible to protect the visitors from undue exposure to radiations. Following precautionary measures should be adopted for the protection of personnel visiting the patients:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii. iv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nVisitors should not be allowed to visit their patients within 48 hours after administration of radio-iodine. Un-necessary visits/meetings should be discouraged. Pregnant women and children under the age of 18 should not be permitted to visit the patient admitted in isolation room. The duration of visit should be as short as possible. Visitors should be advised to keep themselves at a reasonable distance from the patient (preferably at a distance of about 2m or behind the shielded screens). Visitors should be advised not to kiss the patient and not even eat, drink or smoke in the patient\\'s room.\\n\\nvi. Visitors should also be advised to avoid using the toilet or sink in the patient\\'s\\n\\nroom.\\n\\n9\\n\\nRADIATION PROTECTION PROGRAM\\n\\nThe management of a facility/nuclear medicine center must ensure that a Radiation Protection Program is developed, documented, implemented and regularly reviewed to ensure safety in all practices in which radioisotopes are used. The radiation protection program of the facility should include the following:\\n\\ni. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii.\\n\\nWork practices; Roles and responsibilities of RPO, Nursing Staff etc; Radiation monitoring requirements and availability of monitoring equipment ; Control of incidents involving contamination; Storage and transportation arrangements of radiopharmaceuticals; Radiation protection measures applicable in isolation rooms; Inventory control and records of radiopharmaceuticals; and\\n\\n14\\n\\nviii. Any other requirement that may have bearing on safety.\\n\\n10 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES\\n\\nEach facility/nuclear medicine center is responsible to ensure that emergency plan for the incidents and emergencies involving radionuclides is developed and effectively implemented. Emergency procedures for the implementation of emergency plan should be identified while developing the emergency plan of the facility. Following items should be considered during preparation of emergency procedures:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nInstructions on immediate actions that need to be taken to protect human life, limit injury and provide first aid where required; Instructions on immediate actions needed to bring the incident under control, including details on actions necessary to prevent further spread of contamination (if this possibility arises); Instructions for personnel involved to report the incident to RPO or his designated alternate; Instructions for the RPO or his designated alternate to communicate this information and any follow-up on the developing situation to PNRA; Lists containing names, addresses and telephone numbers of responsible personnel required in the event of an emergency (these should be checked and updated at least once every six months and/or whenever changes in the arrangements are made); Instructions to be followed when safety procedures or working rules are not sufficient; and Instructions on emergency response actions following radioactive spillage, vomiting, fire, flood, explosion or any other disaster or incident within the facility.\\n\\n15\\n\\n11 REFERENCES\\n\\n[1] [2]\\n\\n[3]\\n\\n[4] [5]\\n\\nPNRA “Regulations on Radiation Protection” - PAK/904.

Box 1912, Islamabad www.pnra.org\\n\\nPROTECTION OF PATIENTS IN DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\n“Radiology” is the most extensive and commonly used application of ionizing radiation and it gives largest amount of radiation dose to the population worldwide. Since, radiology is an important tool for diagnosis, therefore, diagnostic procedures have become routine part of clinical life and the number of such procedures is ever increasing. Keeping in view the diversity of patients and nature of their examinations, dose limits are not applicable in diagnostic procedures. In fact, the guidance levels are established for radiological procedure so that required clinical information for diagnosis may be obtained at a reasonable amount of radiation dose; which is the ultimate goal of “optimization in patient doses”.\\n\\nThe patient doses are affected by a number of parameters such as equipments, techniques and expertise. This regulatory guide addresses the appropriateness of operating parameters such as mAs, kVp and; equipments including grid, collimator and image receptors; techniques like general radiography, mammography and fluoroscopy; and knowledge/skills of operating personnel. In addition to this, various administrative issues such as responsibilities and training of workers have also been addressed in this regulatory guide.\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................1 OBJECTIVE ...............................................................................................................1 SCOPE ...............................................................................................................1 PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION PROTECTION AND PATIENT SAFETY .........1 Justification ........................................................................................................1 4.1. 4.2.

According to United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), there are over 3.6 billion medical radiation imaging procedures carried out annually. According to survey conducted by UNSCEAR for the period from 1997-2007, total effective dose from medical diagnostic examinations is estimated to have increased approximately 70% [2]. The radiation protection is, therefore, becoming increasingly important to ensure radiation safety of the patients. PNRA “Regulations on Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)\" establish dose levels for diagnostic and interventional radiology. These guidance levels serve as baseline for the development of protocols for minimization of patient doses subject to diagnostic procedures. Dose reduction requires careful attention to equipment specifications. Any modifications in operational factors may result in variation of dose to patient(s). All attempts should be made to conform to good radiation practices and to minimize doses to individual patient.\\n\\n2 OBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance to the licensees of medical facilities and describe different ways through which doses can be reduced without compromising the diagnostic information.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThis regulatory guide applies to individuals, practices or facilities where diagnostic or\\n\\ninterventional diagnostic examinations are performed.\\n\\n4\\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF RADIATION PROTECTION AND PATIENT SAFETY\\n\\n4.1. Justification\\n\\nMedical exposures should be justified by weighing the diagnostic benefits they produce against the radiation detriment they might cause, taking into account the benefits and risks of available alternative techniques such as Ultrasonography (USG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), etc.\\n\\n4.2. Optimization\\n\\nThe optimization of radiation protection and safety, when applied to the exposure of workers and members of the public, attendants and comforters of patients undergoing radiological procedures, is a process of ensuring that likelihood and magnitude of exposures and the number of individuals exposed are As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), with economic, societal and environmental factors taken into account.\\n\\nIn diagnostic radiology, the required clinical information for diagnosis can be obtained\\n\\n1\\n\\nwith minimum exposure of patients by taking into account:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nThe relevant information from previous examinations in order to avoid unnecessary additional examinations; Proper selection of equipment and procedures; Qualification and continuous training of workers; Effective quality assurance program; The relevant guidance levels for medical exposure; Assessment/audits of practices for continuous improvement.\\n\\nŸ\\n\\n5\\n\\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF MEDICAL/HEALTH PROFESSIONALS\\n\\nAs per Regulation 35(1)(b) of “Regulations on Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)\", \"The licensee shall ensure that medical professionals are assigned the primary task and obligation of ensuring overall patient protection and safety in the prescription of, and during the delivery of, medical exposure\" [3]. The first step in reduction of patient doses is the availability of a qualified Radiologist, Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO) and Radiographer.\\n\\nResponsibilities of medical/health professionals regarding protection of patients in\\n\\ndiagnostic radiology are given below:\\n\\n5.1. Responsibilities of Radiologist\\n\\nThe radiologist should ensure that:\\n\\ni. Overall radiation protection of the patient is achieved; ii.\\n\\nExposure of the patient is kept to the minimum required to achieve the intended objective, taking into account the relevant guidance levels for medical exposure;\\n\\niii.

Qualification and training needs of radiation workers including Medical\\n\\nPhysicist/RPO and Radiographers are established;\\n\\nvii. Appropriate training and retraining of radiation workers (i.e. Medical Physicist/RPO\\n\\nand Radiographers) is arranged periodically.\\n\\n5.2. Responsibilities of Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO)\\n\\nThe Medical Physicist/RPO is responsible for technical and administrative matters\\n\\nrelated to radiation protection at the facility. The Medical Physicist/RPO should ensure:\\n\\ni. Overall radiation protection of patients at the facility;\\n\\n2\\n\\nii. Development of Radiation Protection and Quality Assurance (QA) Program and\\n\\niii.\\n\\nrelevant procedures; Implementation of regulatory requirements, Radiation Protection and QA Program and applicable procedures;\\n\\niv. Supervision/conduct of Quality Control (QC) test of X-ray machine(s) and other\\n\\nequipment/accessories; v. Training of workers on radiation safety and radiological protection of patients; vi. Maintenance of records relevant to QC of equipment and radiation protection.\\n\\n5.3. Responsibilities of Radiographer/Operator\\n\\nThe main responsibility of the radiographer/operator is to:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nComply with the facility operating procedures; Identify the patient correctly by:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nName; Gender; ID/ CNIC/ Passport Number; and Date of birth, address and any unique patient number.\\n\\niii.

Routinely review their work practices to optimize operational protocols.\\n\\nBe well aware of any dose reduction techniques specific to the equipment;\\n\\n6\\n\\nFACTORS AFFECTING DOSES IN X-RAY IMAGING PROCEDURES\\n\\nFactors affecting patient doses in all X-ray imaging procedures include beam energy, filtration, collimation, patient size, image processing and expertise of relevant staff. In conventional radiography, one of the important determinants of acceptable patient dose is the use of accurate peak kilo-voltage (kVp). Digital radiography allows much wider range of exposures than conventional radiography for producing diagnostic images. However, operators must be aware of subtle differences in techniques used with digital systems to avoid unnecessary exposure to patients. Mammography requires lower ranges of kVp; different target materials, filters, and screen-film combinations; special attention to breast thickness, composition and compression during the study; and different standards for grids, magnification and optical density. Although, kVp and tube current are important for controlling patient doses in fluoroscopy, however, collimation, source-to-skin and patient-to- image intensifier distances and control of beam-on time also play an important role. Computed\\n\\n3\\n\\nTomography (CT) involves greater patient doses than conventional radiography. Although, primary radiation dose is delivered to smaller volumes, however, dose calculations in CT must account for dose received by the adjacent tissue section(s) as well.\\n\\n6.1. Radiography\\n\\nRadiography refers to create a planar image using X-rays. In radiography, Entrance Surface Dose (ESD) is very important factor which is proportional to the tube current, the length of exposure and the square of kVp. Another factor is inverse square law which states that when all other factors are held constant, the dose at any location is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.\\n\\n6.1.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional Radiography.\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Filtration: Beam energy primarily depends on kVp selected and the amount of filtration in the beam. Selection of higher kVp increases beam penetrability. In practice, this may allow for use of a lower tube current or a shorter exposure, thereby reducing dose to the patient. It is advisable to use a total filtration (which includes the tube wall and any other added filtration) of at least 2.5 mm of Aluminum equivalent, if machines are operated at tube potentials above 70 kVp. This filtration preferentially absorbs the low energy X-rays in the beam. Without filtration, this low energy radiation may completely be absorbed in the patient\\'s body, thereby contributing to patient dose without contributing to the image. However, added filtration increases the average energy of X-ray beam which results in better image quality. Collimation: During any diagnostic procedure, the area of patient\\'s body exposed should be limited to the area of clinical interest. By using collimation, unnecessary patient exposure can be substantially reduced. It has an added effect by reducing the area of X-ray beam and the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor thereby increasing the contrast of the final images.\\n\\niii. Grid: Grid is used in radiography to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor, and to improve the image contrast. It, at the same time, results in higher patient dose. High quality images, obtained by using grid, may result in fewer retakes, however, more accurate diagnosis. Patient Size: With the increase in thickness of the imaging area, kVp should also be increased to obtain required results. Although no control can be exercised over the patient size, however, it is beneficial to know the types of exposures expected for examinations of different anatomical areas and patients of different sizes. Technique charts, that display different radiographic technique factors for various examinations, displayed near the operator\\'s console may be helpful in this regard. Screen-Film Combinations: Use of a faster screen-film combination can substantially reduce dose. Faster systems may result in some loss of details.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\n4\\n\\n6.1.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Digital Radiography\\n\\nDigital Radiography (DR) is the process in which X-ray image is captured through a digital image capture device, saved for future record and is made available for interpretation or further assessment. The advantages of DR over film include; immediate image preview and availability, a wider dynamic range which makes it more forgiving for over and under exposure as well as the ability to apply special image processing techniques that enhance overall display of the image. The largest motivator for healthcare facilities to adopt DR is its potential to reduce costs associated with processing, managing and storing films.\\n\\nIn digital radiography, there is a trade-off between image quality, noise, and patient dose. Efforts to reduce radiation doses during imaging studies have been traditionally limited by a lower image quality, but the use of digital modalities may offer an opportunity to reduce exposure with images of adequate quality. Many approaches are available to acquire better image quality with minimum possible exposures. One way is to increase kVp with corresponding decrease in milliampere-seconds (mAs) product. This technique increases beam penetration thereby providing adequate exposure to image receptors while reducing relative absorption in patient and therefore, reducing patient dose.\\n\\n6.2 Mammography\\n\\nMammography is an X-ray examination of the breast. It is the most reliable method of detecting breast cancer. Its principal purpose is to facilitate the detection of breast cancer at a point earlier in its natural history than is possible by clinical examination. The factors that affect diagnostic radiography also apply to mammography. However, it involves different parameters because of different nature of the tissue being imaged. Generally, the term “Average Glandular Dose\" (AGD) is used to describe the dose to a breast tissue in mammography.\\n\\n6.2.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Mammography\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy: The mammographic range of peak kVp is much lower than that used for all other applications of radiography because high contrast is required to image the soft breast tissues. Small differences in beam energy in mammography greatly affect the resulting dose to the patient. Target Material: Different target materials yield X-rays of different energies, therefore, patient dose is affected when different target materials are used. Molybdenum which emits characteristic X-rays of approximately 18 and 20 kV is used as a target material. Recently, Rhodium which emits characteristic X-rays of approximately 23 kV is being used for imaging thick or dense breasts. Tungsten has also been used as a target material. It is useful while imaging thick and dense breast tissues.\\n\\niii. Filter Material: Filters are used to shape the X-ray energy spectrum. Filters absorb\\n\\n5\\n\\nlow energy X-rays that do not contribute to image formation and high energy X-rays that would degrade image contrast. In mammography, imaging is performed at the characteristic energy of the target material. Therefore, to avail characteristic energy peak of the target material, same material is used as a filter. For example, Molybdenum and Rhodium are used as filter materials along with Molybdenum and Rhodium targets respectively. Molybdenum selectively filters out a high percentage of X-rays with energies more than 20 kV and Rhodium X-rays with energies more than 23 kV. Rhodium filters result in more penetrating X-ray beam and can provide a substantial dose reduction when imaging thick, dense breast tissues.\\n\\niv. Grid: In mammography, grid is used to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor. The bucky factor for mammography grid is usually in the range of 2-3.\\n\\nv. Magnification: Magnification can be an excellent tool for imaging very small breast lesions but it also increases the AGD. Magnification is achieved by moving the breast further away from the image receptor and closer to the X-ray tube. The increase in the distance of breast from the image receptor and the fact that grid is removed during magnification results in increased AGD.\\n\\nvi. Breast Thickness and Tissue Composition: Thickness and composition of breast tissues have substantial impact on patient dose. High energy X-ray beam and longer exposure time are required to obtain acceptable images in case of thick and dense breast tissue and hence results in high AGD.\\n\\nvii. Compression: Compression of the breast tissue results in a lower AGD as the\\n\\nthickness is reduced. It also results in more uniform exposure to the breast.\\n\\nviii. Image Optical Density: Optical Density (OD) refers to the darkness, or density of the exposed film. If greater optical density is required, more exposure will be needed. Increasing the optical density of films results in higher AGD to patients. Screen-Film Combinations: Screen-film combinations of various speeds can also be used in mammography. As in mammograms, greater detail is required, therefore, a slower screen-film combination is used which results in a higher AGD.\\n\\nix.\\n\\n6.3 Fluoroscopy\\n\\nFluoroscopy is used to obtain real-time images for diagnostic purposes and to get\\n\\nguidance for other medical procedures.\\n\\n6.3.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Fluoroscopy\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Tube Current: Beam energy (kVp) as well as tube current (mA) plays an important role in patient dose. Higher kVp and lower tube current results in more penetrating beam. Increasing tube current results in increasing the number of photons which ultimately yield to increasing patient dose. Maintaining the highest kVp that will produce acceptable image contrast leads to lower patient dose. Collimation: In fluoroscopy collimators are important in considerations of the patient\\n\\n6\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\ndose. Extended “beam-on” time may be used in fluoroscopy which may result in substantially higher doses to the areas surrounding the area of clinical interest. This potential overexposure can easily be avoided by using small field size required to image the area of interest only. Proper collimation also reduces the contribution of scattered radiation and leads to higher quality images. Source-to-Skin Distance: The dose rate of a fluoroscopic X-ray beam as it exits the X- ray tube is extremely high. Increasing the source-to-skin distance decreases the dose to patient. Maintaining the maximum possible distance between X-ray source and the patient body is the most effective means of reducing patient dose. Patient-to-Image Intensifier Distance: Distance between the patient and the image intensifier also has substantial effect on patient dose. By decreasing the distance, the dose rate of the X-ray beam can be reduced. Decrease in dose rate results in lower cumulative dose to the patient. However, minimizing this distance also means that a large fraction of scattered radiation will contribute to image. It is widely accepted, however, that minimizing patient-to-image intensifier distance is the most preferred method to reduce patient dose. Image Magnification: Image magnification results in higher patient dose. Magnification can be achieved by two means, namely; geometric and electronic. Geometric magnification is obtained by moving the image intensifier further away from the patient, by moving the X-ray source closer to the patient or both. In electronic magnification of the image, the size of X-ray beam may be restricted to impinge on a portion of the image intensifier only. This technique usually produces an increase in patient dose, although to a smaller degree than geometric magnification.\\n\\nvi. Grid: Use of grid in fluoroscopy reduces the amount of scattered radiation and yields images with improved contrast. Patient doses, however, increase by a factor of two or more. In some cases grids may be removed without a substantial loss in image contrast e.g. when the patient is small and when the patient-to-image intensifier distances is sufficiently large.\\n\\nvii. Patient Size: Thick patient or dense areas within patient body cause more X-ray beam to be absorbed or scattered. The backscatter factor also contributes to an increased ESD in thicker patients. Operators should realize that ESD accumulates more rapidly in obese patients making them more susceptible to radiation burns.\\n\\nviii. Beam–On Time: The amount of dose delivered to a patient is directly proportional to the amount of time the X-ray source is energized, creating a real time image. Use of short intermittent exposures rather than extended continuous exposures also reduce patient dose. Keeping beam-on time to a minimum is the most effective way to reduce the patient dose. It is advisable to maintain written records of beam-on times. These records may prove useful if patient doses are to be estimated.\\n\\n6.3.2 Patient Doses in Fluoroscopy\\n\\nThe dose rate to a patient in fluoroscopy is greatest at the skin. The entrance exposure\\n\\n7\\n\\nlimit for standard operation of a fluoroscope is 25 mGy/min for normal and 100 mGy/min for high level operation mode [3].\\n\\nAppropriate protocols should be available at every facility for physicians to minimize doses to the patients in order to avoid deterministic effects (e.g. burns) and occurrence of stochastic effects (e.g. cancer).\\n\\n6.4 Computed Tomography (CT)\\n\\nCT stands for computed tomography. The CT scan can reveal anatomic details of internal organs that cannot be seen in conventional X-rays. The X-ray tube spins rapidly around the patient and the X-rays strike numerous detectors after passing through the body. These detectors are connected to sophisticated computers which generate images after image processing. The radiation dose of a CT scanner is much higher than a conventional X-ray, but the information obtained from a CT scan is often much greater.\\n\\nTwo most commonly reported doses for CT are those delivered during head and body scans. Currently, in latest equipment available in the market, CT Dose Index (CTDI) values are usually provided by the manufacturers.\\n\\nGenerally, in CT scan, Multi Scan Average Dose (MSAD) ranges from 40 – 60 mGy (4-6 rad) for head scans and from 10 – 40 mGy (1-4 rad) for body scans. Whereas, a scout scan usually results in a surface dose of approximately 1 mGy (100 mrad) [4].\\n\\n6.4.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional CT\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Filtration: Radiation dose in diagnostic radiology mainly depends on beam energy; the higher the beam energy for an exposure, the higher will be the patient dose. Use of most appropriate kVp for a given examination is important to keep patient doses minimum. The type of filter placed in the X-ray beam also plays an important role in resulting beam energy in CT. These filters may be shaped to present different thicknesses at different points across the X-ray beam. The type of filter used for a specific CT examination is usually determined by the manufacturer and can reduce the ratio of surface dose to midline dose. Collimation: Collimation of X-ray beam plays a significant role in patient doses in CT. Effective utilization of pre-patient collimators confine the beam to section thickness intended at the area of interest and keep the doses minimum to the adjacent tissues. Another set of collimators may be positioned post-patient or pre-detector to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the detector. Images with better contrast and resolution are obtained through this technique which may affect patient dose indirectly.\\n\\niii. Number and Spacing of Adjacent Sections: Patient dose in CT is also affected by the number and spacing of adjacent sections. When more sections are scanned, more volume of tissue is irradiated. The MSAD may increase because of the penumbra\\n\\n8\\n\\niv.\\n\\nresulting from scattered radiation and possible beam divergence. With the increase in ratio between section thickness and section interval, the MSAD also increases because of increasing contributions from neighboring sections. Image Quality and Noise: Statistical noise and loss of image contrast as a result of scattered radiation are most important factors affecting image quality. The dose used to acquire the image increases with the decrease in noise. To maintain acceptable levels of noise, the kVp and tube current used to acquire the image may need to be increased.\\n\\n6.4.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Spiral CT\\n\\nIn spiral CT, continuous scanning of patient while the couch is moving through the scanner is possible. A large volume of the tissue can be scanned in a relatively short time in spiral CT. All the variables of traditional CT also apply to spiral CT, however, scan pitch is an additional important factor that must be considered in spiral CT.\\n\\nPitch is a ratio of distance that patient\\'s couch travels during 360º gantry rotation to the section thickness. If the couch travels 10 mm during one rotation and the section thickness is 10 mm, the pitch would be 1 (one). The larger the pitch, more tissue can be imaged during the same scan interval.\\n\\nFor a spiral CT examination with a pitch of 1 (one), the dose to patient should be comparable with the dose delivered in a traditional CT of the same volume of the tissue. Patient dose is inversely proportional to pitch, as the pitch is increased, the dose at any point along the volume of tissue decreases and vice versa.\\n\\n6.5 Dental Radiology\\n\\nDental radiography is the process of taking the X-ray images (pictures) of a teeth, bones, and soft tissues around them to help find problems with the teeth. It is one of the most frequent type of radiology procedures performed. Although, exposure associated with dental radiology is relatively low, however, radiological procedure should be justified and optimized to keep the radiation risk as low as reasonably possible. In dental radiology, ESD without backscatter for intraoral examinations and the Dose Width Product (DWP) for panoramic examinations is recommended for the setting of Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) [5].\\n\\n6.5.1 Factors Contributing Dose Variation\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nCollimation, Field- Size Trimming: Rectangular collimation which approximates the size and shape of the receptor reduces the dose significantly in comparison with circular collimation. A dose reduction exceeding 60% can be achieved in dental radiology by using rectangular collimation. Choice of Image Receptor: Digital detectors have the potential for further dose reduction, even compared with F-speed film, provided the repeat rate and use of\\n\\n9\\n\\nhigher exposure factors than necessary are controlled. The fastest available film consistent with achieving satisfactory diagnostic results should be used. E-speed and F-speed films reduce doses more than 50% compared with D-speed films.\\n\\niii. X-ray Generation and Kilo-voltage: For dental radiology, 65-70 kV is recommended as kilo-voltage of choice in intraoral X-ray sets using AC equipment, with 60 kV for those using DC X-ray sets.\\n\\niv. Filtration: X-ray tube filtration should be sufficient to reduce entrance surface dose to the patient consistent with producing satisfactory image quality. Filtration by aluminum is a key method of reducing skin dose to patients. Position Indication Device: A position indication device which ensures minimum focus-to-skin distance of 20 cm should be attached to the tube head (e.g. by use of a long collimator/cone as compared to a short conical one).\\n\\nv.\\n\\n6.6\\n\\nIn Utero Exposure in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\nPNRA Regulations on Radiation Protection (PAK/904), requires medical practitioners to avoid exposure to abdomen or pelvis of women patients who are or likely to be pregnant. If the exposure to any other body part or even to the abdomen/pelvis is justified, the medical practitioner is required to plan and conduct the exposure appropriately.\\n\\n6.6.1 Factors Affecting Fetal Dose in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nDirect (inside field of view) Exposure: If a fetus is located within the field of view of a particular examination, such as studies of the abdomen, pelvis and lumbar spine, it is exposed directly to primary beam radiation. This situation typically results in the highest fetal doses. Shielding in such situations becomes ineffective because it cannot cover the area being imaged. Indirect (outside field of view) Exposure: In case of examinations of skull and extremities, bulk of the exposure received by a fetus is from indirect scattered radiation from maternal tissues. The dose received in this situation is lower than the direct exposure. Shielding in this situation is again of limited value as most of the fetal dose results from internal scatter in the mother.\\n\\n6.6.2 Fetal Dose Estimation in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\nFetal doses are estimated using the following imaging techniques:\\n\\ni. Output intensity (measured in exposure or air kerma) of the X-ray equipment for diagnostic exposures, entrance exposure (or air kerma rate) and fluoroscopic exposures, along with the conditions of the examination should be known; The Half-Value Layer (HVL) should be used to determine beam penetrability; Information about the conditions of procedure should include the location, number of images taken and radiographic exposure factors; For fluoroscopic procedures, the beam-on time and number of digital or cassette spot images taken should also be known;\\n\\nii. iii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\n10\\n\\nv.\\n\\nPatient information should include fetal age at the time of exposure, patient\\'s size and thickness, depth of fetus, and orientation of patient.\\n\\nAccording to the data published in the Article of Radiographics [4], estimated doses to\\n\\nuterus from typical diagnostic procedures are listed in the Table-1.\\n\\nTable-1 : Estimated Doses to the Uterus from Typical Diagnostic Procedures\\n\\nEXAMINATION\\n\\nABSORBED DOSE mGy mrad\\n\\nUpper Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) Series\\n\\n1\\n\\n100\\n\\nCholecystography\\n\\n1\\n\\n100\\n\\nLumbar Spine Radiography\\n\\n4\\n\\n400\\n\\nPelvic Radiography\\n\\n2\\n\\n200\\n\\nHip and Femur Radiography\\n\\n3\\n\\n300\\n\\nRetrograde Pyelography\\n\\n6\\n\\n600\\n\\nBarium Enema Study\\n\\n10\\n\\n1000\\n\\nAbdominal Radiography (KUB)\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n250\\n\\nHysterosalpingography (HSG)\\n\\n10\\n\\n1000\\n\\nCT Ÿ Head Ÿ Chest Ÿ Abdomen\\n\\nApprox 0 0.16 30\\n\\nApprox 0 16 3000\\n\\nThe medical/health professionals at a diagnostic radiology facility should be aware of the effect of the factors/technical parameters such as KVp, mAs, collimation etc. on dose and image quality and they should select appropriate parameters, as relevant, such that their combination produce the minimum patient exposure consistent with the acceptable image quality and clinical purpose of the examination.\\n\\n6.7 Film Processing\\n\\nPatients may undergo repeated X-ray examinations after their initial X-ray radiographs are rejected due to poor image quality. Good quality of radiographs cannot be acquired without proper film processing.\\n\\nIn manual processing, technical factors, such as developer temperature, developing time and chemistry replenishment, affect the quality of the films and are much more difficult to control. The darkrooms, in manual processing, should be equipped with a timer and\\n\\n11\\n\\nthermometer, and a time-temperature development table which should be followed for processing all the films.\\n\\nAutomatic film processing is preferred because of less processing time. The film processor should be used according to the manufacturer\\'s recommendations. If temperature, transport rate or replenishment rates differ substantially from the recommended values, the effects on the image quality can be significant which may lead to modification of radiographic techniques that in turn directly affect patient\\'s dose.\\n\\nFilm processing conditions are also important in mammography. Manufacturer\\'s recommendations for processing should be strictly followed. Deviations can lead to use of improper exposure techniques thereby increasing the patient dose. Another consideration is the length of film-processing cycle which can be either standard or extended. Extended cycle and processing allows a decrease in dose required to produce acceptable images. However, not all mammography films are compatible with extended-cycle processing.\\n\\n7 MANAGING PATIENT DOSES\\n\\nThe factors affecting the management of patient doses are described in the following\\n\\nsections:\\n\\n7.1 Developments in Equipments and Accessories\\n\\nTechnical development that made most significant contribution to patient dose reduction is the intensifying screen. From direct film radiography to modern rare earth phosphors (typically Oxysulphides or Oxybromides of Gadolinium and Lanthanum), dose reduction of a factor of 15-500 have been made possible, depending upon the type of screen and film used. Rare earth screens have three to five times better dose efficiency as compared to Calcium Tungstate screens which are still in common use [7]. Spectral sensitivity of a film should match the emission spectrum of the intensifying screen used. Any mismatch will have financial implications and it may lead to increased radiation doses to the patients. There is thus an immediate scope for dose reduction by switching over to rare earth screens.\\n\\nEquipment with unsatisfactory safety and quality features should not be operated. Type approval of X-ray machines and registration may serve as an efficient method of ensuring conformity to specifications. New X-ray equipments may have malfunctions in one or more of their radiological parameters including; kVp, timing, beam congruence or centering and milli- ampere second linearity of some of their mechanical parameters which can be detected by acceptance testing. A qualified person, preferably a radiology medical physicist, may use these tests to verify that the initial performance of the equipment conforms to the manufacturer\\'s specifications and international standards [8,9]. The person testing the equipment should thoroughly document the results of acceptance tests as those results might be used in part to define the acceptable range of parameters that will be monitored in any subsequent test. If no acceptance testing is carried out, there are 80% chances of starting with a\\n\\n12\\n\\npoorly functioning unit.\\n\\nAfter successful installation and acceptance of equipment, QC testing of the equipment must be carried out on an ongoing basis for continued and reliable performance. A medical physicist should perform QC testing of the equipment at a defined frequency to look for changes that may cause degradation of image quality or an increase in radiation exposure to patient.\\n\\nMoreover, maintenance policy should be established for the maintenance of older equipment to avoid unnecessary exposures. Replacing/changing some of the accessories may also result in a patient dose reduction. Considerable attention should be given to introduction of Carbon fibers in table tops. Typically the dose can be reduced by 3-15% by changing the table top, 6-12% by changing the front of film cassette and 20-30% by using a grid with carbon fiber covers and fiber interspaces [10].\\n\\n7.2 Referrals\\n\\nRadiological examination is advised by the physicians to establish a diagnosis, however, not all the diagnostic examinations are clinically helpful. Expertise of physician, referring diagnostic examination, can help in saving the potential collective dose. Evidence based medicine has become an accepted practice, along with evidence based radiology.\\n\\nThe referring physician bears special responsibility and should use guidelines for diagnosis to a greater extent. The referring physician should take into account all clinical aspects regarding management of every patient individually/separately. In difficult cases, they should also consult with their colleagues in radiology in the selection of the most suitable procedure. Other possible procedures with lower or no exposure, such as USG or MRI, should be considered, if and when appropriate, before proceeding to radiological procedures.\\n\\n7.3 Education and Training\\n\\nThe personnel involved in advice and delivery of any radiology examination should be qualified and receive adequate training. The role played by training and education must be emphasized when it comes to the dose reductions possible in the hands of operators, developing expertise to advice manufacturers, making the right choice of equipment at the time of purchase and spreading a culture of radiation protection among the personnel. A substantial dose reduction (nearly 40%) can be achieved by training of the staff. This is the responsibility of the licensee to plan and execute effective training and re-training programs for its workers.\\n\\n7.4 Dose Guidance Levels\\n\\nPatient doses in diagnostic examinations are controlled by restricting dose up to a certain level, specific for an examination, suggesting that the dose is sufficient to create better quality\\n\\n13\\n\\nimage of human anatomy. Dose guidance levels have been replaced by dose reference levels in recent recommendations of ICRP on radiation protection [11]. The dose guidance levels for conventional radiography, computed tomography and mammography are given in Table-2, Table-3 and Table-4 respectively [3].\\n\\nTable-2 : Dose Guidance Levels for Conventional Radiography\\n\\nExamination\\n\\nEntrance Surface Dose per Radiograph* (mGy)\\n\\nLumbar Spine\\n\\nAP LAT\\n\\n10 30\\n\\nAbdomen, Intravenous Urology and Cholecystography\\n\\nLSJ AP\\n\\n40 10\\n\\nPelvis\\n\\nAP\\n\\n10\\n\\nHip joint\\n\\nAP\\n\\n10\\n\\nChest\\n\\nPA LAT\\n\\n0.4 1.5\\n\\nDental\\n\\nLAT Periapical AP PA\\n\\n20 07 05 05\\n\\nSkull\\n\\nLAT\\n\\n03\\n\\nNotes: PA: posterior-anterior projection; LAT: lateral projection; LSJ: lumbo-sacral-joint projection;\\n\\nAP: anterior-posterior projection.\\n\\nIn air with backscatter, these values are for conventional film-screen combination in the relative speed of 200.

With the improvement of imaging technology, the radiation doses in an examination can be significantly reduced with good image quality. Furthermore, better performance and selection of proper technique in the same examination for different human beings further reduce the population dose. Many countries all over the world perform periodic surveys to assess the patient doses in diagnostic examinations. On the basis of the results thus obtained, the guidance levels are revised to lower doses.\\n\\n7.5 Clinical Dosimetry in Radiology\\n\\nRadiation protection of patients undergoing medical X-ray examinations is governed by the principles of justification and optimization. Radiation dosimetry is required to inform medical practitioners of the levels of exposure and hence the risks associated with the diagnostic procedures that they have to justify and to assist the operators of X-ray imaging equipment to determine whether their procedures are optimized. The dosimetric quantities to be considered during diagnostic work are:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nESD for individual radiographs; Dose-Area Product (DAP) for individual radiographs; DAP for complete examinations involving radiography and/or fluoroscopy; Weighted CT Dose Index (CTDIw) per slice in spiral CT scanning or per rotation in helical CT scanning; Dose-Length Product (DLP) per complete CT examination.\\n\\n7.5.1 Entrance Surface Dose\\n\\nIt is the entrance air Kerma with backscatter from patient skin. It is usually expressed in milligray (mGy) and can be measured directly with suitably calibrated TLDs attached to the patient\\'s skin or with ionization chambers supported in free air on the X-ray beam axis, corrected to the Focus Skin Distance (FSD) and by a suitable backscatter factor. It is the quantity of more concern for practical patient dosimetry. Specific X-ray tube output measurements, as a function of tube voltage (kV) and charge (mAs) made during routine quality assurance programs, are frequently used to calculate ESD values from the exposure parameters (kV, mAs, FSD) used for radiographs on a particular patient [12].\\n\\n15\\n\\n7.5.2 Dose Area Product\\n\\nIt is the absorbed dose to air (or the air kerma) averaged over the area of X-ray beam in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis, multiplied by the area of beam (A) in the same plane. It is usually expressed in Gy-cm2 and being invariant with distance from X-ray tube focus, it is conveniently measured with special large area ionization chambers (DAP meters) attached to the diaphragm housing of the X-ray tube, which intercept the entire cross section of the beam. They essentially integrate the absorbed dose over whole beam area for any number of diagnostic or fluoroscopic exposures and can thus provide a single measurement of total amount of radiation used in a complete X-ray examination involving radiography and fluoroscopy. DAP meters should be calibrated after installation on an X-ray set to take account of the particular scatter conditions and attenuating material between the DAP meter and the patient (e.g. the table top for under-couch X-ray tubes) [12].\\n\\n7.5.3 CT Dose Index\\n\\nThe principal dosimetric quantity used in CT is the CTDI. This is defined as the integral along a line parallel to the axis of rotation (z) of the dose profile [D(z)] for a single rotation and a fixed table position, divided by the nominal thickness of the X-ray beam. CTDI can be conveniently assessed using a pencil ionization chamber with an active length of 100 mm, so as to provide a measurement of CTDI100, expressed in terms of absorbed dose to air (mGy) [13].\\n\\nWhere \"n\" is the number of tomographic slices, each of nominal thickness \"T\", imaged\\n\\nduring a single rotation.\\n\\n7.6 Assessment of Exposure to the Patient at Individual X-ray Facilities\\n\\nPatient exposure assessment should always be associated with monitoring image information. Patient exposure and image quality assessments at individual facilities should be carried out on a sample of typical patients.\\n\\nAssessment of patient doses serve the following purposes:\\n\\ni. ii. Comparing doses and dose distributions for the same type of examination, done with different exposure parameters or with different equipment, or in different X-ray rooms or different hospitals or different countries, or to monitor improvement by making comparisons before and after changes;\\n\\nEstablishing guidance levels (reference levels);\\n\\niii. Comparing patient exposure for different types of examinations. Effective dose is, therefore, used for comparison; however, the caution of using effective doses for patients as indicated in UNSCEAR should be kept in mind;\\n\\niv. Assessing relative contributions to collective doses from various types of examinations or even comparing medical with non-medical radiation exposure of\\n\\n16\\n\\n8\\n\\nthe population;\\n\\nv.

Since, radiology is an important tool for diagnosis, therefore, diagnostic procedures have become routine part of clinical life and the number of such procedures is ever increasing. Keeping in view the diversity of patients and nature of their examinations, dose limits are not applicable in diagnostic procedures. In fact, the guidance levels are established for radiological procedure so that required clinical information for diagnosis may be obtained at a reasonable amount of radiation dose; which is the ultimate goal of “optimization in patient doses”.\\n\\nThe patient doses are affected by a number of parameters such as equipments, techniques and expertise. This regulatory guide addresses the appropriateness of operating parameters such as mAs, kVp and; equipments including grid, collimator and image receptors; techniques like general radiography, mammography and fluoroscopy; and knowledge/skills of operating personnel. In addition to this, various administrative issues such as responsibilities and training of workers have also been addressed in this regulatory guide.\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................1 OBJECTIVE ...............................................................................................................1 SCOPE ...............................................................................................................1 PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION PROTECTION AND PATIENT SAFETY .........1 Justification ........................................................................................................1 4.1. 4.2.

According to United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), there are over 3.6 billion medical radiation imaging procedures carried out annually. According to survey conducted by UNSCEAR for the period from 1997-2007, total effective dose from medical diagnostic examinations is estimated to have increased approximately 70% [2]. The radiation protection is, therefore, becoming increasingly important to ensure radiation safety of the patients. PNRA “Regulations on Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)\" establish dose levels for diagnostic and interventional radiology. These guidance levels serve as baseline for the development of protocols for minimization of patient doses subject to diagnostic procedures. Dose reduction requires careful attention to equipment specifications. Any modifications in operational factors may result in variation of dose to patient(s). All attempts should be made to conform to good radiation practices and to minimize doses to individual patient.\\n\\n2 OBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance to the licensees of medical facilities and describe different ways through which doses can be reduced without compromising the diagnostic information.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThis regulatory guide applies to individuals, practices or facilities where diagnostic or\\n\\ninterventional diagnostic examinations are performed.\\n\\n4\\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF RADIATION PROTECTION AND PATIENT SAFETY\\n\\n4.1. Justification\\n\\nMedical exposures should be justified by weighing the diagnostic benefits they produce against the radiation detriment they might cause, taking into account the benefits and risks of available alternative techniques such as Ultrasonography (USG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), etc.\\n\\n4.2. Optimization\\n\\nThe optimization of radiation protection and safety, when applied to the exposure of workers and members of the public, attendants and comforters of patients undergoing radiological procedures, is a process of ensuring that likelihood and magnitude of exposures and the number of individuals exposed are As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), with economic, societal and environmental factors taken into account.\\n\\nIn diagnostic radiology, the required clinical information for diagnosis can be obtained\\n\\n1\\n\\nwith minimum exposure of patients by taking into account:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nThe relevant information from previous examinations in order to avoid unnecessary additional examinations; Proper selection of equipment and procedures; Qualification and continuous training of workers; Effective quality assurance program; The relevant guidance levels for medical exposure; Assessment/audits of practices for continuous improvement.\\n\\nŸ\\n\\n5\\n\\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF MEDICAL/HEALTH PROFESSIONALS\\n\\nAs per Regulation 35(1)(b) of “Regulations on Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)\", \"The licensee shall ensure that medical professionals are assigned the primary task and obligation of ensuring overall patient protection and safety in the prescription of, and during the delivery of, medical exposure\" [3]. The first step in reduction of patient doses is the availability of a qualified Radiologist, Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO) and Radiographer.\\n\\nResponsibilities of medical/health professionals regarding protection of patients in\\n\\ndiagnostic radiology are given below:\\n\\n5.1. Responsibilities of Radiologist\\n\\nThe radiologist should ensure that:\\n\\ni. Overall radiation protection of the patient is achieved; ii.\\n\\nExposure of the patient is kept to the minimum required to achieve the intended objective, taking into account the relevant guidance levels for medical exposure;\\n\\niii. Optimized protocols for diagnostic procedures are established; iv. Guidance is being provided for examination of the pregnant women, pediatric\\n\\npatients, medico-legal procedures, and occupational health examinations;\\n\\nv. Any radiation incident or accident is evaluated and investigated from medical point\\n\\nof view;\\n\\nvi. Qualification and training needs of radiation workers including Medical\\n\\nPhysicist/RPO and Radiographers are established;\\n\\nvii. Appropriate training and retraining of radiation workers (i.e. Medical Physicist/RPO\\n\\nand Radiographers) is arranged periodically.\\n\\n5.2. Responsibilities of Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO)\\n\\nThe Medical Physicist/RPO is responsible for technical and administrative matters\\n\\nrelated to radiation protection at the facility. The Medical Physicist/RPO should ensure:\\n\\ni. Overall radiation protection of patients at the facility;\\n\\n2\\n\\nii. Development of Radiation Protection and Quality Assurance (QA) Program and\\n\\niii.\\n\\nrelevant procedures; Implementation of regulatory requirements, Radiation Protection and QA Program and applicable procedures;\\n\\niv. Supervision/conduct of Quality Control (QC) test of X-ray machine(s) and other\\n\\nequipment/accessories; v. Training of workers on radiation safety and radiological protection of patients; vi. Maintenance of records relevant to QC of equipment and radiation protection.\\n\\n5.3. Responsibilities of Radiographer/Operator\\n\\nThe main responsibility of the radiographer/operator is to:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nComply with the facility operating procedures; Identify the patient correctly by:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nName; Gender; ID/ CNIC/ Passport Number; and Date of birth, address and any unique patient number.\\n\\niii. Verify that the female patient is not pregnant; iv. Brief the patient(s) about the procedure, correct positioning and immobilization\\n\\nduring exposure;\\n\\nv. Use appropriate shielding for patient such as lead apron, gonad shield etc.; vi. Perform QC tests under the supervision of Medical Physicist.\\n\\nAdditionally, operators should:\\n\\ni. ii. Routinely review their work practices to optimize operational protocols.\\n\\nBe well aware of any dose reduction techniques specific to the equipment;\\n\\n6\\n\\nFACTORS AFFECTING DOSES IN X-RAY IMAGING PROCEDURES\\n\\nFactors affecting patient doses in all X-ray imaging procedures include beam energy, filtration, collimation, patient size, image processing and expertise of relevant staff. In conventional radiography, one of the important determinants of acceptable patient dose is the use of accurate peak kilo-voltage (kVp). Digital radiography allows much wider range of exposures than conventional radiography for producing diagnostic images. However, operators must be aware of subtle differences in techniques used with digital systems to avoid unnecessary exposure to patients. Mammography requires lower ranges of kVp; different target materials, filters, and screen-film combinations; special attention to breast thickness, composition and compression during the study; and different standards for grids, magnification and optical density. Although, kVp and tube current are important for controlling patient doses in fluoroscopy, however, collimation, source-to-skin and patient-to- image intensifier distances and control of beam-on time also play an important role. Computed\\n\\n3\\n\\nTomography (CT) involves greater patient doses than conventional radiography. Although, primary radiation dose is delivered to smaller volumes, however, dose calculations in CT must account for dose received by the adjacent tissue section(s) as well.\\n\\n6.1. Radiography\\n\\nRadiography refers to create a planar image using X-rays. In radiography, Entrance Surface Dose (ESD) is very important factor which is proportional to the tube current, the length of exposure and the square of kVp. Another factor is inverse square law which states that when all other factors are held constant, the dose at any location is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.\\n\\n6.1.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional Radiography.\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Filtration: Beam energy primarily depends on kVp selected and the amount of filtration in the beam. Selection of higher kVp increases beam penetrability. In practice, this may allow for use of a lower tube current or a shorter exposure, thereby reducing dose to the patient. It is advisable to use a total filtration (which includes the tube wall and any other added filtration) of at least 2.5 mm of Aluminum equivalent, if machines are operated at tube potentials above 70 kVp. This filtration preferentially absorbs the low energy X-rays in the beam. Without filtration, this low energy radiation may completely be absorbed in the patient\\'s body, thereby contributing to patient dose without contributing to the image. However, added filtration increases the average energy of X-ray beam which results in better image quality. Collimation: During any diagnostic procedure, the area of patient\\'s body exposed should be limited to the area of clinical interest. By using collimation, unnecessary patient exposure can be substantially reduced. It has an added effect by reducing the area of X-ray beam and the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor thereby increasing the contrast of the final images.\\n\\niii. Grid: Grid is used in radiography to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor, and to improve the image contrast. It, at the same time, results in higher patient dose. High quality images, obtained by using grid, may result in fewer retakes, however, more accurate diagnosis. Patient Size: With the increase in thickness of the imaging area, kVp should also be increased to obtain required results. Although no control can be exercised over the patient size, however, it is beneficial to know the types of exposures expected for examinations of different anatomical areas and patients of different sizes. Technique charts, that display different radiographic technique factors for various examinations, displayed near the operator\\'s console may be helpful in this regard. Screen-Film Combinations: Use of a faster screen-film combination can substantially reduce dose. Faster systems may result in some loss of details.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\n4\\n\\n6.1.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Digital Radiography\\n\\nDigital Radiography (DR) is the process in which X-ray image is captured through a digital image capture device, saved for future record and is made available for interpretation or further assessment. The advantages of DR over film include; immediate image preview and availability, a wider dynamic range which makes it more forgiving for over and under exposure as well as the ability to apply special image processing techniques that enhance overall display of the image. The largest motivator for healthcare facilities to adopt DR is its potential to reduce costs associated with processing, managing and storing films.\\n\\nIn digital radiography, there is a trade-off between image quality, noise, and patient dose. Efforts to reduce radiation doses during imaging studies have been traditionally limited by a lower image quality, but the use of digital modalities may offer an opportunity to reduce exposure with images of adequate quality. Many approaches are available to acquire better image quality with minimum possible exposures. One way is to increase kVp with corresponding decrease in milliampere-seconds (mAs) product. This technique increases beam penetration thereby providing adequate exposure to image receptors while reducing relative absorption in patient and therefore, reducing patient dose.\\n\\n6.2 Mammography\\n\\nMammography is an X-ray examination of the breast. It is the most reliable method of detecting breast cancer. Its principal purpose is to facilitate the detection of breast cancer at a point earlier in its natural history than is possible by clinical examination. The factors that affect diagnostic radiography also apply to mammography. However, it involves different parameters because of different nature of the tissue being imaged. Generally, the term “Average Glandular Dose\" (AGD) is used to describe the dose to a breast tissue in mammography.\\n\\n6.2.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Mammography\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy: The mammographic range of peak kVp is much lower than that used for all other applications of radiography because high contrast is required to image the soft breast tissues. Small differences in beam energy in mammography greatly affect the resulting dose to the patient. Target Material: Different target materials yield X-rays of different energies, therefore, patient dose is affected when different target materials are used. Molybdenum which emits characteristic X-rays of approximately 18 and 20 kV is used as a target material. Recently, Rhodium which emits characteristic X-rays of approximately 23 kV is being used for imaging thick or dense breasts. Tungsten has also been used as a target material. It is useful while imaging thick and dense breast tissues.\\n\\niii. Filter Material: Filters are used to shape the X-ray energy spectrum. Filters absorb\\n\\n5\\n\\nlow energy X-rays that do not contribute to image formation and high energy X-rays that would degrade image contrast. In mammography, imaging is performed at the characteristic energy of the target material. Therefore, to avail characteristic energy peak of the target material, same material is used as a filter. For example, Molybdenum and Rhodium are used as filter materials along with Molybdenum and Rhodium targets respectively. Molybdenum selectively filters out a high percentage of X-rays with energies more than 20 kV and Rhodium X-rays with energies more than 23 kV. Rhodium filters result in more penetrating X-ray beam and can provide a substantial dose reduction when imaging thick, dense breast tissues.\\n\\niv. Grid: In mammography, grid is used to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image receptor. The bucky factor for mammography grid is usually in the range of 2-3.\\n\\nv. Magnification: Magnification can be an excellent tool for imaging very small breast lesions but it also increases the AGD. Magnification is achieved by moving the breast further away from the image receptor and closer to the X-ray tube. The increase in the distance of breast from the image receptor and the fact that grid is removed during magnification results in increased AGD.\\n\\nvi. Breast Thickness and Tissue Composition: Thickness and composition of breast tissues have substantial impact on patient dose. High energy X-ray beam and longer exposure time are required to obtain acceptable images in case of thick and dense breast tissue and hence results in high AGD.\\n\\nvii. Compression: Compression of the breast tissue results in a lower AGD as the\\n\\nthickness is reduced. It also results in more uniform exposure to the breast.\\n\\nviii. Image Optical Density: Optical Density (OD) refers to the darkness, or density of the exposed film. If greater optical density is required, more exposure will be needed. Increasing the optical density of films results in higher AGD to patients. Screen-Film Combinations: Screen-film combinations of various speeds can also be used in mammography. As in mammograms, greater detail is required, therefore, a slower screen-film combination is used which results in a higher AGD.\\n\\nix.\\n\\n6.3 Fluoroscopy\\n\\nFluoroscopy is used to obtain real-time images for diagnostic purposes and to get\\n\\nguidance for other medical procedures.\\n\\n6.3.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Fluoroscopy\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Tube Current: Beam energy (kVp) as well as tube current (mA) plays an important role in patient dose. Higher kVp and lower tube current results in more penetrating beam. Increasing tube current results in increasing the number of photons which ultimately yield to increasing patient dose. Maintaining the highest kVp that will produce acceptable image contrast leads to lower patient dose. Collimation: In fluoroscopy collimators are important in considerations of the patient\\n\\n6\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\ndose. Extended “beam-on” time may be used in fluoroscopy which may result in substantially higher doses to the areas surrounding the area of clinical interest. This potential overexposure can easily be avoided by using small field size required to image the area of interest only. Proper collimation also reduces the contribution of scattered radiation and leads to higher quality images. Source-to-Skin Distance: The dose rate of a fluoroscopic X-ray beam as it exits the X- ray tube is extremely high. Increasing the source-to-skin distance decreases the dose to patient. Maintaining the maximum possible distance between X-ray source and the patient body is the most effective means of reducing patient dose. Patient-to-Image Intensifier Distance: Distance between the patient and the image intensifier also has substantial effect on patient dose. By decreasing the distance, the dose rate of the X-ray beam can be reduced. Decrease in dose rate results in lower cumulative dose to the patient. However, minimizing this distance also means that a large fraction of scattered radiation will contribute to image. It is widely accepted, however, that minimizing patient-to-image intensifier distance is the most preferred method to reduce patient dose. Image Magnification: Image magnification results in higher patient dose. Magnification can be achieved by two means, namely; geometric and electronic. Geometric magnification is obtained by moving the image intensifier further away from the patient, by moving the X-ray source closer to the patient or both. In electronic magnification of the image, the size of X-ray beam may be restricted to impinge on a portion of the image intensifier only. This technique usually produces an increase in patient dose, although to a smaller degree than geometric magnification.\\n\\nvi. Grid: Use of grid in fluoroscopy reduces the amount of scattered radiation and yields images with improved contrast. Patient doses, however, increase by a factor of two or more. In some cases grids may be removed without a substantial loss in image contrast e.g. when the patient is small and when the patient-to-image intensifier distances is sufficiently large.\\n\\nvii. Patient Size: Thick patient or dense areas within patient body cause more X-ray beam to be absorbed or scattered. The backscatter factor also contributes to an increased ESD in thicker patients. Operators should realize that ESD accumulates more rapidly in obese patients making them more susceptible to radiation burns.\\n\\nviii. Beam–On Time: The amount of dose delivered to a patient is directly proportional to the amount of time the X-ray source is energized, creating a real time image. Use of short intermittent exposures rather than extended continuous exposures also reduce patient dose. Keeping beam-on time to a minimum is the most effective way to reduce the patient dose. It is advisable to maintain written records of beam-on times. These records may prove useful if patient doses are to be estimated.\\n\\n6.3.2 Patient Doses in Fluoroscopy\\n\\nThe dose rate to a patient in fluoroscopy is greatest at the skin. The entrance exposure\\n\\n7\\n\\nlimit for standard operation of a fluoroscope is 25 mGy/min for normal and 100 mGy/min for high level operation mode [3].\\n\\nAppropriate protocols should be available at every facility for physicians to minimize doses to the patients in order to avoid deterministic effects (e.g. burns) and occurrence of stochastic effects (e.g. cancer).\\n\\n6.4 Computed Tomography (CT)\\n\\nCT stands for computed tomography. The CT scan can reveal anatomic details of internal organs that cannot be seen in conventional X-rays. The X-ray tube spins rapidly around the patient and the X-rays strike numerous detectors after passing through the body. These detectors are connected to sophisticated computers which generate images after image processing. The radiation dose of a CT scanner is much higher than a conventional X-ray, but the information obtained from a CT scan is often much greater.\\n\\nTwo most commonly reported doses for CT are those delivered during head and body scans. Currently, in latest equipment available in the market, CT Dose Index (CTDI) values are usually provided by the manufacturers.\\n\\nGenerally, in CT scan, Multi Scan Average Dose (MSAD) ranges from 40 – 60 mGy (4-6 rad) for head scans and from 10 – 40 mGy (1-4 rad) for body scans. Whereas, a scout scan usually results in a surface dose of approximately 1 mGy (100 mrad) [4].\\n\\n6.4.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional CT\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nBeam Energy and Filtration: Radiation dose in diagnostic radiology mainly depends on beam energy; the higher the beam energy for an exposure, the higher will be the patient dose. Use of most appropriate kVp for a given examination is important to keep patient doses minimum. The type of filter placed in the X-ray beam also plays an important role in resulting beam energy in CT. These filters may be shaped to present different thicknesses at different points across the X-ray beam. The type of filter used for a specific CT examination is usually determined by the manufacturer and can reduce the ratio of surface dose to midline dose. Collimation: Collimation of X-ray beam plays a significant role in patient doses in CT. Effective utilization of pre-patient collimators confine the beam to section thickness intended at the area of interest and keep the doses minimum to the adjacent tissues. Another set of collimators may be positioned post-patient or pre-detector to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the detector. Images with better contrast and resolution are obtained through this technique which may affect patient dose indirectly.\\n\\niii. Number and Spacing of Adjacent Sections: Patient dose in CT is also affected by the number and spacing of adjacent sections. When more sections are scanned, more volume of tissue is irradiated. The MSAD may increase because of the penumbra\\n\\n8\\n\\niv.\\n\\nresulting from scattered radiation and possible beam divergence. With the increase in ratio between section thickness and section interval, the MSAD also increases because of increasing contributions from neighboring sections. Image Quality and Noise: Statistical noise and loss of image contrast as a result of scattered radiation are most important factors affecting image quality. The dose used to acquire the image increases with the decrease in noise. To maintain acceptable levels of noise, the kVp and tube current used to acquire the image may need to be increased.\\n\\n6.4.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Spiral CT\\n\\nIn spiral CT, continuous scanning of patient while the couch is moving through the scanner is possible. A large volume of the tissue can be scanned in a relatively short time in spiral CT. All the variables of traditional CT also apply to spiral CT, however, scan pitch is an additional important factor that must be considered in spiral CT.\\n\\nPitch is a ratio of distance that patient\\'s couch travels during 360º gantry rotation to the section thickness. If the couch travels 10 mm during one rotation and the section thickness is 10 mm, the pitch would be 1 (one). The larger the pitch, more tissue can be imaged during the same scan interval.\\n\\nFor a spiral CT examination with a pitch of 1 (one), the dose to patient should be comparable with the dose delivered in a traditional CT of the same volume of the tissue. Patient dose is inversely proportional to pitch, as the pitch is increased, the dose at any point along the volume of tissue decreases and vice versa.\\n\\n6.5 Dental Radiology\\n\\nDental radiography is the process of taking the X-ray images (pictures) of a teeth, bones, and soft tissues around them to help find problems with the teeth. It is one of the most frequent type of radiology procedures performed. Although, exposure associated with dental radiology is relatively low, however, radiological procedure should be justified and optimized to keep the radiation risk as low as reasonably possible. In dental radiology, ESD without backscatter for intraoral examinations and the Dose Width Product (DWP) for panoramic examinations is recommended for the setting of Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) [5].\\n\\n6.5.1 Factors Contributing Dose Variation\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nCollimation, Field- Size Trimming: Rectangular collimation which approximates the size and shape of the receptor reduces the dose significantly in comparison with circular collimation. A dose reduction exceeding 60% can be achieved in dental radiology by using rectangular collimation. Choice of Image Receptor: Digital detectors have the potential for further dose reduction, even compared with F-speed film, provided the repeat rate and use of\\n\\n9\\n\\nhigher exposure factors than necessary are controlled. The fastest available film consistent with achieving satisfactory diagnostic results should be used. E-speed and F-speed films reduce doses more than 50% compared with D-speed films.\\n\\niii. X-ray Generation and Kilo-voltage: For dental radiology, 65-70 kV is recommended as kilo-voltage of choice in intraoral X-ray sets using AC equipment, with 60 kV for those using DC X-ray sets.\\n\\niv. Filtration: X-ray tube filtration should be sufficient to reduce entrance surface dose to the patient consistent with producing satisfactory image quality. Filtration by aluminum is a key method of reducing skin dose to patients. Position Indication Device: A position indication device which ensures minimum focus-to-skin distance of 20 cm should be attached to the tube head (e.g. by use of a long collimator/cone as compared to a short conical one).\\n\\nv.\\n\\n6.6\\n\\nIn Utero Exposure in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\nPNRA Regulations on Radiation Protection (PAK/904), requires medical practitioners to avoid exposure to abdomen or pelvis of women patients who are or likely to be pregnant. If the exposure to any other body part or even to the abdomen/pelvis is justified, the medical practitioner is required to plan and conduct the exposure appropriately.\\n\\n6.6.1 Factors Affecting Fetal Dose in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nDirect (inside field of view) Exposure: If a fetus is located within the field of view of a particular examination, such as studies of the abdomen, pelvis and lumbar spine, it is exposed directly to primary beam radiation. This situation typically results in the highest fetal doses. Shielding in such situations becomes ineffective because it cannot cover the area being imaged. Indirect (outside field of view) Exposure: In case of examinations of skull and extremities, bulk of the exposure received by a fetus is from indirect scattered radiation from maternal tissues. The dose received in this situation is lower than the direct exposure. Shielding in this situation is again of limited value as most of the fetal dose results from internal scatter in the mother.\\n\\n6.6.2 Fetal Dose Estimation in Diagnostic Radiography\\n\\nFetal doses are estimated using the following imaging techniques:\\n\\ni. Output intensity (measured in exposure or air kerma) of the X-ray equipment for diagnostic exposures, entrance exposure (or air kerma rate) and fluoroscopic exposures, along with the conditions of the examination should be known; The Half-Value Layer (HVL) should be used to determine beam penetrability; Information about the conditions of procedure should include the location, number of images taken and radiographic exposure factors; For fluoroscopic procedures, the beam-on time and number of digital or cassette spot images taken should also be known;\\n\\nii. iii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\n10\\n\\nv.\\n\\nPatient information should include fetal age at the time of exposure, patient\\'s size and thickness, depth of fetus, and orientation of patient.\\n\\nAccording to the data published in the Article of Radiographics [4], estimated doses to\\n\\nuterus from typical diagnostic procedures are listed in the Table-1.\\n\\nTable-1 : Estimated Doses to the Uterus from Typical Diagnostic Procedures\\n\\nEXAMINATION\\n\\nABSORBED DOSE mGy mrad\\n\\nUpper Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) Series\\n\\n1\\n\\n100\\n\\nCholecystography\\n\\n1\\n\\n100\\n\\nLumbar Spine Radiography\\n\\n4\\n\\n400\\n\\nPelvic Radiography\\n\\n2\\n\\n200\\n\\nHip and Femur Radiography\\n\\n3\\n\\n300\\n\\nRetrograde Pyelography\\n\\n6\\n\\n600\\n\\nBarium Enema Study\\n\\n10\\n\\n1000\\n\\nAbdominal Radiography (KUB)\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n250\\n\\nHysterosalpingography (HSG)\\n\\n10\\n\\n1000\\n\\nCT Ÿ Head Ÿ Chest Ÿ Abdomen\\n\\nApprox 0 0.16 30\\n\\nApprox 0 16 3000\\n\\nThe medical/health professionals at a diagnostic radiology facility should be aware of the effect of the factors/technical parameters such as KVp, mAs, collimation etc. on dose and image quality and they should select appropriate parameters, as relevant, such that their combination produce the minimum patient exposure consistent with the acceptable image quality and clinical purpose of the examination.\\n\\n6.7 Film Processing\\n\\nPatients may undergo repeated X-ray examinations after their initial X-ray radiographs are rejected due to poor image quality. Good quality of radiographs cannot be acquired without proper film processing.\\n\\nIn manual processing, technical factors, such as developer temperature, developing time and chemistry replenishment, affect the quality of the films and are much more difficult to control. The darkrooms, in manual processing, should be equipped with a timer and\\n\\n11\\n\\nthermometer, and a time-temperature development table which should be followed for processing all the films.\\n\\nAutomatic film processing is preferred because of less processing time. The film processor should be used according to the manufacturer\\'s recommendations. If temperature, transport rate or replenishment rates differ substantially from the recommended values, the effects on the image quality can be significant which may lead to modification of radiographic techniques that in turn directly affect patient\\'s dose.\\n\\nFilm processing conditions are also important in mammography. Manufacturer\\'s recommendations for processing should be strictly followed. Deviations can lead to use of improper exposure techniques thereby increasing the patient dose. Another consideration is the length of film-processing cycle which can be either standard or extended. Extended cycle and processing allows a decrease in dose required to produce acceptable images. However, not all mammography films are compatible with extended-cycle processing.\\n\\n7 MANAGING PATIENT DOSES\\n\\nThe factors affecting the management of patient doses are described in the following\\n\\nsections:\\n\\n7.1 Developments in Equipments and Accessories\\n\\nTechnical development that made most significant contribution to patient dose reduction is the intensifying screen. From direct film radiography to modern rare earth phosphors (typically Oxysulphides or Oxybromides of Gadolinium and Lanthanum), dose reduction of a factor of 15-500 have been made possible, depending upon the type of screen and film used. Rare earth screens have three to five times better dose efficiency as compared to Calcium Tungstate screens which are still in common use [7]. Spectral sensitivity of a film should match the emission spectrum of the intensifying screen used. Any mismatch will have financial implications and it may lead to increased radiation doses to the patients. There is thus an immediate scope for dose reduction by switching over to rare earth screens.\\n\\nEquipment with unsatisfactory safety and quality features should not be operated. Type approval of X-ray machines and registration may serve as an efficient method of ensuring conformity to specifications. New X-ray equipments may have malfunctions in one or more of their radiological parameters including; kVp, timing, beam congruence or centering and milli- ampere second linearity of some of their mechanical parameters which can be detected by acceptance testing. A qualified person, preferably a radiology medical physicist, may use these tests to verify that the initial performance of the equipment conforms to the manufacturer\\'s specifications and international standards [8,9]. The person testing the equipment should thoroughly document the results of acceptance tests as those results might be used in part to define the acceptable range of parameters that will be monitored in any subsequent test. If no acceptance testing is carried out, there are 80% chances of starting with a\\n\\n12\\n\\npoorly functioning unit.\\n\\nAfter successful installation and acceptance of equipment, QC testing of the equipment must be carried out on an ongoing basis for continued and reliable performance. A medical physicist should perform QC testing of the equipment at a defined frequency to look for changes that may cause degradation of image quality or an increase in radiation exposure to patient.\\n\\nMoreover, maintenance policy should be established for the maintenance of older equipment to avoid unnecessary exposures. Replacing/changing some of the accessories may also result in a patient dose reduction. Considerable attention should be given to introduction of Carbon fibers in table tops. Typically the dose can be reduced by 3-15% by changing the table top, 6-12% by changing the front of film cassette and 20-30% by using a grid with carbon fiber covers and fiber interspaces [10].\\n\\n7.2 Referrals\\n\\nRadiological examination is advised by the physicians to establish a diagnosis, however, not all the diagnostic examinations are clinically helpful. Expertise of physician, referring diagnostic examination, can help in saving the potential collective dose. Evidence based medicine has become an accepted practice, along with evidence based radiology.\\n\\nThe referring physician bears special responsibility and should use guidelines for diagnosis to a greater extent. The referring physician should take into account all clinical aspects regarding management of every patient individually/separately. In difficult cases, they should also consult with their colleagues in radiology in the selection of the most suitable procedure. Other possible procedures with lower or no exposure, such as USG or MRI, should be considered, if and when appropriate, before proceeding to radiological procedures.\\n\\n7.3 Education and Training\\n\\nThe personnel involved in advice and delivery of any radiology examination should be qualified and receive adequate training. The role played by training and education must be emphasized when it comes to the dose reductions possible in the hands of operators, developing expertise to advice manufacturers, making the right choice of equipment at the time of purchase and spreading a culture of radiation protection among the personnel. A substantial dose reduction (nearly 40%) can be achieved by training of the staff. This is the responsibility of the licensee to plan and execute effective training and re-training programs for its workers.\\n\\n7.4 Dose Guidance Levels\\n\\nPatient doses in diagnostic examinations are controlled by restricting dose up to a certain level, specific for an examination, suggesting that the dose is sufficient to create better quality\\n\\n13\\n\\nimage of human anatomy. Dose guidance levels have been replaced by dose reference levels in recent recommendations of ICRP on radiation protection [11]. The dose guidance levels for conventional radiography, computed tomography and mammography are given in Table-2, Table-3 and Table-4 respectively [3].\\n\\nTable-2 : Dose Guidance Levels for Conventional Radiography\\n\\nExamination\\n\\nEntrance Surface Dose per Radiograph* (mGy)\\n\\nLumbar Spine\\n\\nAP LAT\\n\\n10 30\\n\\nAbdomen, Intravenous Urology and Cholecystography\\n\\nLSJ AP\\n\\n40 10\\n\\nPelvis\\n\\nAP\\n\\n10\\n\\nHip joint\\n\\nAP\\n\\n10\\n\\nChest\\n\\nPA LAT\\n\\n0.4 1.5\\n\\nDental\\n\\nLAT Periapical AP PA\\n\\n20 07 05 05\\n\\nSkull\\n\\nLAT\\n\\n03\\n\\nNotes: PA: posterior-anterior projection; LAT: lateral projection; LSJ: lumbo-sacral-joint projection;\\n\\nAP: anterior-posterior projection.\\n\\nIn air with backscatter, these values are for conventional film-screen combination in the relative speed of 200. For high speed film-screen combinations (400- 600), the values should be reduced by a factor of 2 to 3.\\n\\nTable-3: Dose Guidance Levels for Computed Tomography\\n\\nExamination\\n\\nMultiple Scan Average Dose* (mGy)\\n\\nHead\\n\\n50\\n\\nLumbar Spine\\n\\n35\\n\\nAbdomen\\n\\n25\\n\\nDerived from measurements on the axis of rotation in water equivalent phantoms, 15 cm in length and 16 cm (head) and 30 cm (lumbar spine and abdomen) in diameter.\\n\\n14\\n\\nTable-4: Dose Guidance Levels for Mammography\\n\\nAverage Glandular dose (mGy) per Cranio-Caudal Projection*\\n\\n1 (without grid) 3 (with grid)\\n\\nDetermined in a 4.5 cm compressed breast consisting of 50 % glandular and 50 % adipose tissue, for film-screen systems and dedicated Mo-target Mo-filter mammography units.\\n\\nDose guidance levels have been established through worldwide survey practices. With the improvement of imaging technology, the radiation doses in an examination can be significantly reduced with good image quality. Furthermore, better performance and selection of proper technique in the same examination for different human beings further reduce the population dose. Many countries all over the world perform periodic surveys to assess the patient doses in diagnostic examinations. On the basis of the results thus obtained, the guidance levels are revised to lower doses.\\n\\n7.5 Clinical Dosimetry in Radiology\\n\\nRadiation protection of patients undergoing medical X-ray examinations is governed by the principles of justification and optimization. Radiation dosimetry is required to inform medical practitioners of the levels of exposure and hence the risks associated with the diagnostic procedures that they have to justify and to assist the operators of X-ray imaging equipment to determine whether their procedures are optimized. The dosimetric quantities to be considered during diagnostic work are:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nESD for individual radiographs; Dose-Area Product (DAP) for individual radiographs; DAP for complete examinations involving radiography and/or fluoroscopy; Weighted CT Dose Index (CTDIw) per slice in spiral CT scanning or per rotation in helical CT scanning; Dose-Length Product (DLP) per complete CT examination.\\n\\n7.5.1 Entrance Surface Dose\\n\\nIt is the entrance air Kerma with backscatter from patient skin. It is usually expressed in milligray (mGy) and can be measured directly with suitably calibrated TLDs attached to the patient\\'s skin or with ionization chambers supported in free air on the X-ray beam axis, corrected to the Focus Skin Distance (FSD) and by a suitable backscatter factor. It is the quantity of more concern for practical patient dosimetry. Specific X-ray tube output measurements, as a function of tube voltage (kV) and charge (mAs) made during routine quality assurance programs, are frequently used to calculate ESD values from the exposure parameters (kV, mAs, FSD) used for radiographs on a particular patient [12].\\n\\n15\\n\\n7.5.2 Dose Area Product\\n\\nIt is the absorbed dose to air (or the air kerma) averaged over the area of X-ray beam in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis, multiplied by the area of beam (A) in the same plane. It is usually expressed in Gy-cm2 and being invariant with distance from X-ray tube focus, it is conveniently measured with special large area ionization chambers (DAP meters) attached to the diaphragm housing of the X-ray tube, which intercept the entire cross section of the beam. They essentially integrate the absorbed dose over whole beam area for any number of diagnostic or fluoroscopic exposures and can thus provide a single measurement of total amount of radiation used in a complete X-ray examination involving radiography and fluoroscopy. DAP meters should be calibrated after installation on an X-ray set to take account of the particular scatter conditions and attenuating material between the DAP meter and the patient (e.g. the table top for under-couch X-ray tubes) [12].\\n\\n7.5.3 CT Dose Index\\n\\nThe principal dosimetric quantity used in CT is the CTDI. This is defined as the integral along a line parallel to the axis of rotation (z) of the dose profile [D(z)] for a single rotation and a fixed table position, divided by the nominal thickness of the X-ray beam. CTDI can be conveniently assessed using a pencil ionization chamber with an active length of 100 mm, so as to provide a measurement of CTDI100, expressed in terms of absorbed dose to air (mGy) [13].\\n\\nWhere \"n\" is the number of tomographic slices, each of nominal thickness \"T\", imaged\\n\\nduring a single rotation.\\n\\n7.6 Assessment of Exposure to the Patient at Individual X-ray Facilities\\n\\nPatient exposure assessment should always be associated with monitoring image information. Patient exposure and image quality assessments at individual facilities should be carried out on a sample of typical patients.\\n\\nAssessment of patient doses serve the following purposes:\\n\\ni. ii. Comparing doses and dose distributions for the same type of examination, done with different exposure parameters or with different equipment, or in different X-ray rooms or different hospitals or different countries, or to monitor improvement by making comparisons before and after changes;\\n\\nEstablishing guidance levels (reference levels);\\n\\niii. Comparing patient exposure for different types of examinations. Effective dose is, therefore, used for comparison; however, the caution of using effective doses for patients as indicated in UNSCEAR should be kept in mind;\\n\\niv. Assessing relative contributions to collective doses from various types of examinations or even comparing medical with non-medical radiation exposure of\\n\\n16\\n\\n8\\n\\nthe population;\\n\\nv. Analyzing trends in the use of radiation e.g. change in frequency and dose per examination, introduction of new examination techniques or modification of techniques; and\\n\\nvi. Comparison of patient doses with guidance levels to get an idea if doses are on the\\n\\nhigh side.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIAEA, \"Radiation Doses in Diagnostic Radiology and Methods for Dose Reduction\", TECDOC-796, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna (1995)\\n\\n2.

An integrated QA approach, taking into account medical, physical and radiation safety aspects, can improve nuclear medicine in achieving adequate image quality at the lowest reasonable doses to the patients.\\n\\nThe responsibility of QA/QC lies with the licensee/user. However, this guide provides an outline of a QA programme which encompasses the overall QA of a nuclear medicine facility. In the light of this guide, the user may develop their respective QA/QC protocols. For further reference Guidelines on Radiation Safety and Regulatory Requirements for Nuclear Medicine Facilities can be consulted.\\n\\nTheAuthority in this guide means Pakistan Nuclear RegulatoryAuthority.\\n\\n2\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective is to provide a baseline to the licensee for the establishment of a comprehensive QA programme to ensure radiation protection and safety so that all necessary procedures are developed and implemented according to Radiation Protection Regulations (PAK-904) within the country.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThe scope of the guide is to address all areas in a nuclear medicine department where QA protocols are essential for ensuring radiation protection and safety. It includes not only QA of the instruments and radiopharmaceuticals but also addresses all administrative and technical parameters that are an integral part of a comprehensive QAprogramme.\\n\\n4\\n\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY ASSURANCE:\\n\\nThree basic principles in a nuclear medicine department are:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nImprovement in the quality of diagnostic information; Acquisition of desired results with minimum amount of radionuclide activity; and Appropriate use of available resources so that the facility can be upgraded to cope with the advance technology.\\n\\nAQAProgram should include the following parameters:\\n\\nI.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii. iv.\\n\\nPhysical parameters of the radiation generators, imaging devices and irradiation installation at the time of commissioning and periodically thereafter; Means for verification of the appropriate physical and clinical factors used for diagnosis and therapy; Written records of relevant procedures & results; Verification of the appropriate calibration and conditions of operation of\\n\\n2\\n\\nv.\\n\\ndosimetry and monitoring equipment; and Regular and independent quality audit.\\n\\n5\\n\\nOPTIMIZATION OF QA\\n\\n5.1\\n\\nDesign of the Facility\\n\\nThe design of the facility should take into consideration:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nThe type of work and the radionuclides and their activities intended to be used; Categorization of hazards to determine the special needs concerning ventilation, plumbing, materials used in walls, floors and work benches; The layout of a typical nuclear medicine department and building requirements is given inAnnexure I.\\n\\n5.2\\n\\nQA Program Organization\\n\\nIt includes:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nProcedures: The procedures include patient history, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, appropriateness of investigation, precautions to be taken and any contraindications, etc; Planning of procedures: This means that appropriately defined administrative procedures, patient system, patient preparation areas etc; Clinical procedures: It means that procedures for the purchase of equipment, radiopharmaceuticals etc are defined and only approved suppliers are listed. In addition, storage & preparation of radiopharmaceuticals, clinical environment, patient handling & preparation, equipment acquisition and performance protocols and waste disposal procedures must be available; All medical and paramedical staff in a nuclear medicine department should be qualified and have on the job training on radtiation protection.

They must include visual inspection of the package and monitoring of external radiation levels and removable contamination if the package is damaged, verification that the contents confirm with the packing slip and with the purchase order and monitoring of the packing material and empty package.\\n\\nFor further details PNRA “Guidelines on Radiation Safety and Regulatory\\n\\nRequirements for Nuclear Medicine Facilities” may be consulted.\\n\\n7.1.2\\n\\nCheck of Sources\\n\\nThe procedures should include provision for safe handling of sources and the\\n\\nverification of activity.\\n\\n7.1.3\\n\\nStorage\\n\\nProcedures should include the use of appropriate shielding, choice of an appropriate location and a check of the external dose rate to verify that it does not exceed the limits specified. Radiation level limits for various labeled packages are given in table 1.\\n\\nFor storage of radionuclides like I-131, the following precautions should be\\n\\nfollowed:\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nIt should be stored in a controlled area; It should always be stored in a lead container and preferably in fume hood or refrigerator to prevent evaporation; and In order to reach an acceptable external dose rate, 1.4 cm thick lead shield is required.\\n\\n7\\n\\nTable 1: Radiation Level Limits for Labeled Packages\\n\\nTRANSPORT INDEX (TI)\\n\\nMAXIMUM RADIATION LEVEL AT ANY POINT ON EXTERNAL SURFACE\\n\\nCATEGORY\\n\\n0a\\n\\nNot more than 0.005mSv/h\\n\\nWhite – I\\n\\nMore than 0 but not more than 1a\\n\\nMore than 0.005mSv/h but not more than 0.5mSv/h\\n\\nYellow – II\\n\\nMore than 1 but not more than 10\\n\\nMore than 0.5 mSv/h but not more than 2 mSv/h\\n\\nYellow – III\\n\\nMore than 10\\n\\nMore than 2 mSv/h but not more than 10 mSv/h\\n\\nYellow - IIIb\\n\\na = The TI shall be rounded up to the first decimal place except that a value of 0.05 or less may be considered as zero. b = shall be transported under exclusive use.\\n\\n7.1.4\\n\\nHandling of Radioactive Waste\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of hospital management to collect, segregate and dispose off radioactive waste according to the Regulations on Radioactive Waste Management (PAK-915). For further reference, PNRA Safety Guide “Guidelines for the Management of Radioactive Waste in Hospitals/Nuclear medical Centres/Research Facilities (13002)” may be consulted.\\n\\n7.1.5\\n\\nSource Transport\\n\\nThe hospital administration/person responsible should make local rules for in-\\n\\nhouse transport of radioactive material.\\n\\nIf the injection is to be taken far from the dispensing room for administration to the patient, a transport container with absorbent pads need to be provided. The RPO must ensure that the container is labeled with a radiation warning sign. It must also have the following information: date, activity, name & identification number of the patient for which the injection is prepared, name of the technologist who prepared the dose and the name of the medical professional who prescribed the dose.\\n\\nRPO must ensure that the most direct route is taken for transport avoiding\\n\\nheavily occupied areas and the time taken in the transport must be documented.\\n\\nArecord of all these measures must be kept.\\n\\nThe transportation of sources and radiopharmaceutical are subject to the\\n\\nRegulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material Pak/916.\\n\\n8\\n\\nRADIOPHARMACEUTICALS\\n\\nIn nuclear medicine it is desirable to use relatively short-lived agents which can\\n\\nbe delivered to hospitals & clinics from commercial sources. The nuclear medicine department needs to have a qualified radiopharmacist or a radiochemist. The following are the responsibilities of a radiopharmacist/radiochemist:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n99\\n\\n99m\\n\\nElution of sterile pertechnetate from a Mo/ Tc generator;\\n\\n8\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPreparation of radiopharmaceuticals according to manufacturer\\'s instructions;\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPerformance of quality control procedures on the prepared radiopharmaceuticals.\\n\\nIf a radiopharmacist / radiochemist is not available, the nuclear medicine\\n\\ntechnologist is responsible to carry out these additional responsibilities.\\n\\n8.1\\n\\nRadionuclide Generators\\n\\n99\\n\\n99m\\n\\nThe most important generator is the Mo / Tc system. Commercial generator systems are autoclaved & the elution dynamics quality controlled before shipment. However, each laboratory must perform quality control steps each time the generator is eluted.\\n\\n8.1.1\\n\\nRadionuclide Purity\\n\\n99\\n\\n99m\\n\\n99m\\n\\nThe only desired radionuclide in the Mo/ Tc generator eluate is Tc. Any other radionuclide in the sample is considered an impurity. The amount of Mo in the eluate is subject to limits & must be tested on each elution. The set limit is 0.15µCi of Mo activity per 1.0 mCi of\\n\\n99\\n\\n99m\\n\\nTc activity in the administered dose.\\n\\n8.1.2\\n\\nChemical Purity\\n\\nAnother routine QA step is to measure the generator eluate for the presence of\\n\\nAl O . For fission generators the maximum alumina concentration is10µg/ml.\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n8.1.3\\n\\nRadiochemical Purity\\n\\n99m\\n\\nThe standard set for the generator eluate is that 95 % or more of Tc activity\\n\\nshould be in + 7 states.\\n\\n8.2\\n\\nRadiopharmaceutical Behavior\\n\\nThe behavior of radiopharmaceuticals is dependent upon its quality, which demands high standards of radionuclide, radiochemical and chemical purity and, in case of suspensions, of particle size and uniformity. Injections have to satisfy additional standards of sterility, apyrogenicity and freedom from foreign particulate matter.\\n\\n8.2.1\\n\\nRadionuclide Purity\\n\\nRadionuclide purity is required to avoid unnecessary radiation dose to the patient, to avoid degradation of image quality and to limit errors on measurements. Radionuclide purity depends upon the half-lives of the radionuclides involved. Contaminants with longer half-lives are potentially more hazardous.\\n\\n8.2.2\\n\\nRadiochemical Purity\\n\\nready-to-administer radiopharmaceutical are used or else prepared through the reconstitution of non- radioactive kits by adding a radionuclide. The manufacturing of ready-to-inject radiopharmaceuticals and of non-radioactive kits is subject to quality control.\\n\\nIn a nuclear medicine department, either\\n\\n9\\n\\n99\\n\\n8.2.3\\n\\nChemical Purity and Content\\n\\nIn general, chemical impurities in radiopharmaceuticals are objectionable only\\n\\nif they are toxic or if they interfere or result in the modification of the desired study.\\n\\n8.2.4\\n\\npH\\n\\nThe pH of radiopharmaceutical injections and solutions should be within\\n\\nspecified range.\\n\\n8.2.5\\n\\nSpecific Activity\\n\\nControl of specific activity is particularly important in exchange radio-labeling\\n\\ne.g., in the labeling of an iodo compound by exchange with 123I or 131I.\\n\\n8.3\\n\\nPreparation of Radiopharmaceuticals\\n\\nThe following criteria need to be fulfilled:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\nWritten procedures must be followed in preparation to ensure safe handling of radiopharmaceuticals; Transparent vial shields should be used; A unique code must be followed which can be able to trace the original components in the preparation; Labeling of vials and syringes must be ensured; The activity should be measured; Protective clothing must be available; Tools for remote handling of radioactive material must be available; Containers for radioactive waste are available; Dose rate monitor with alarm should be there; The department should have contamination monitor; Adecontamination kit must be readily available; Appropriate warning signs and labels must be available; Records of radionuclides , kits etc must be maintained;\\n\\n8.4\\n\\nDispensing Radiopharmaceuticals\\n\\nThe following steps must be followed:\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\nCheck the kit & vial shield labels before dispensing; Draw the required volume and measure the activity; Dispense the radionuclide into a shielded syringe (bench top shield, vial shield, syringe shield); Keep the vial in fume hood and on a tray with lips, lined with plastic backed absorbent pads; Handle the vial with forceps or similar long handled instruments; Put the radionuclide in an infusion bottle; Line the bottle to the patient using an intravenous catheter; Keep the patient in bed until the bottle is empty; Cover the vial with lead after use; Check the activity; Remove the bottle and catheter or syringe and dispose them off as\\n\\n10\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nradioactive waste; Document each step;\\n\\n8.5\\n\\nAdministration of Radiopharmaceuticals\\n\\nAccording to the “Regulations on Radiation protection (PAK – 904)”, unsealed sources for nuclear medicine procedures should be calibrated in terms of activity of the radiopharmaceutical to be administered, the activity being determined and recorded at the time of administration.\\n\\nThe following information must be fulfilled prior\\n\\nto injecting\\n\\nradiopharmaceuticals:\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPatient name; Patient identification number – preferably it should include National Identity Card number as well; History of pregnancy and breast feeding from female patients; Check the request form – it should be signed by the nuclear medicine physician; Check the label of the syringe.\\n\\nAnnexure III describes safe administration of I-131 and guidance level.\\n\\n9\\n\\nWORK IN A CONTROLLED AREA\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nAccess to controlled areas must be limited; All regular staff of the area will be issued a personal dosimeter, worn at all times when the person enters the room; Occasional entry of any person without a dosimeter to a controlled area may be permitted under the supervision of an authorized member or RPO; Other personnel who need to enter the controlled area on occasional basis at times when they are not being supervised (works staff, contractors etc) must be issued with a permit to enter the controlled area; Outside normal working hours controlled areas must be locked to prevent unauthorized access.\\n\\nIn order to avoid skin contamination and/or accidental ingestion of\\n\\nradionuclides\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nLaboratory coats or other suitable clothing should be worn to prevent accidental contamination of normal clothes; Disposable plastic gloves should be worn when working with any unsealed sources; Lab coats should be removed and hands washed before eating or drinking and before going home; Disposable handkerchiefs should be used; Skin cuts and abrasions should be covered before working with unsealed sources; If there is any risk of splashing, eyes should be protected e.g., behind the transparent lead block; Mouth pipettes must never be used. Always use a bulb pipette or a syringe\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n11\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nfor measuring radioactive solutions. No one should eat, drink, smoke or apply cosmetics in controlled areas with the following exception:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEating, drinking by a patient as part of a diagnostic procedure e.g., iodine therapy procedure; Eating and drinking is allowed at the nursing station provided that no administration of radioactive substances is carried out at the time and if there is any contamination from previous administration, has been dealt with by qualified persons; In the waiting area, eating and drinking is allowed as the area is not used for administration of radiopharmaceuticals.\\n\\nHowever, if the area gets contaminated by the vomitus or urine or any other body fluids of the patient after radiopharmaceutical administration, the area should be treated as “controlled area”. No one should be allowed to eat and drink till the area is decontaminated and declared safe by RPO.\\n\\nTo avoid spread of contamination:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nActivity must not be splashed around e.g., do not squirt syringes or expel in the air; As far as practicable all operations involving unsealed sources should be carried out over a drip tray; Syringes containing radioactive solutions should be placed, with their shielding, in a tray before transportation; Any bench top which is used for the manipulation of unsealed sources e.g., blood samples, should be covered with absorbent paper which should be replaced if contamination occurs; and While wearing gloves which may be contaminated, unnecessary contact with all other objects should be avoided. Gloves should be removed and disposed off in the radioactive waste bin as soon as work with radioactive substances is finished.\\n\\nTo minimize the hazard from external radiation:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nSources must be kept within suitable lead shielding when not in use. Vials of activity should only be removed from their lead pots when this is absolutely necessary e.g., place in the ionization chamber; Unshielded vials of activity should only be manipulated with long handled tongs; Syringes containing radioactivity should be fitted with lead syringe shields whenever possible; Patient doses should be kept in the shielded storage area until required. Unused doses should be returned to the radionuclide lab at the end of each session; and Personnel should keep as far away as possible from all sources and organize work so as to minimize the time spent in close proximity to large sources e.g., stand back while the Tc generator is eluting.\\n\\n99m\\n\\n12\\n\\n10\\n\\nINSTRUMENTATION\\n\\nThe aim of the QA program for equipment used in nuclear medicine is the prediction or identification of significant changes in technical parameters that could result in a lower or otherwise unsustainable quality of diagnostic and therapeutic results. To make sure that the equipment is working correctly, the following conditions must be fulfilled:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nControls within the quality assurance system must be carried out with suitable frequency ( some daily, others over longer time intervals); Controls must be carried out with sufficient accuracy and reproduction under a procedure according to a clearly written protocol; The results of the controls – including the conditions under which these results have been measured – must be carefully documented. As an element of the controls, it must also be described what must be done in case the measurements are not satisfactory from the point of view of the established criteria.\\n\\nQA is essential not only for maintaining high standards of clinical practice but also for maintaining high performance of equipment. In each department there should be a continuous review process to monitor clinical and equipment performance in accordance with national and international standards. There should also be routines and a policy for purchasing equipment.\\n\\n10.1\\n\\nEquipment Purchase Rules\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of the hospital management to clearly define a policy for\\n\\npurchasing new equipment.\\n\\nThe facility administration should constitute a purchase group\\n\\ncomprising of the following:\\n\\ni. ii. iii. iv. v.\\n\\nNuclear Medicine Specialist; Medical Physicist; Nuclear Medicine Technologist; An Engineer; Aperson with authority from administration.\\n\\nThe need to purchase new equipment depends upon:\\n\\ni. ii. iii. iv.\\n\\nv. vi.\\n\\nStarting a new diagnostic facility; Increased workload of the patient; The technical performance is deteriorated; The equipment performance is not good enough for new techniques/methods; Spare parts are not available; and Un-repairable.\\n\\nChoice of equipment depends upon:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nType of procedures to be undertaken; Technical specifications;\\n\\n13\\n\\niii.

Before the equipment is introduced to its regular use after installation, it is important to check whether its detection parameters correspond to those as specified by the manufacturer in the accompanying documentation. Acceptance tests are also important after any considerable maintenance on the equipment. The aim of the acceptance tests is:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTo compare the measured values of parameters with the values specified by the manufacturer; To control all parameters and features of the equipment that can influence the outcomes of measurements (especially in case of scintillation cameras); and To obtain a basis for performing consistency/routine tests during the use of the equipment at a workplace.\\n\\nThe way the acceptance test is carried out and all criteria used in the test must be declared in the contract with the manufacturer. In this regard, one of the following options can be selected:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe supplier of the equipment himself carries out acceptance tests at the workplace where the equipment is installed in the presence of a specialist (a physician, medical physicist or a technician) of the facility; They are carried out by qualified persons , i.e., employees of the institution buying the equipment; and The supplier and the purchasing institute make an agreement that independent specialist will carry out the tests.\\n\\nRoutine/Consistency Tests\\n\\nWhen the acceptance testing has been completed satisfactorily, their results will provide a baseline data for carrying out routine/consistency checks. The aim of consistency / routine tests is:\\n\\n16\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTo check whether the measured values of the parameters are within the recommended tolerance range of parameters established at the workplace during the acceptance test; and To estimate both short term changes in parameters and long term trends in their gradual changes.\\n\\nThe routine/consistency tests can be distinguished between simple and\\n\\ncomplicated tests.\\n\\na.\\n\\nSimple Tests\\n\\nThese tests utilize a low time frame and are easy to carry out in periods ranging from a few minutes to half an hour, which is very important with regard to the frequent use of the equipment especially the scintillation cameras. Another important aspect of these tests is that they do not require much technical equipment and can be carried out by commonly available equipment which is usually not very expensive. The institute itself is responsible to perform these tests by utilizing existing means.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nComplicated Tests\\n\\nThe most important aspect of the complicated tests is that they require several hours for performance and much more specialized equipment is required or a combination of both. The institution may not have the capability to perform these tests itself. The institution must ask for assistance from the companies providing maintenance of medical equipment or make an agreement with a group of specialists in the field. Another alternative is that while purchasing the equipment, an agreement should be made with the supplier to include the complicated tests in the equipment warranty. However, an occasional consultation with an independent specialist in order to ensure the objectivity of such tests is nevertheless required.\\n\\nAnother important parameter of the QC tests is preventive maintenance of the equipment – examination, cleaning and changing of used parts; this helps to prevent sudden problems that affect the regular clinical operation.\\n\\nc. Analysis of Results\\n\\nThe results of acceptance and routine tests must be recorded carefully and for this\\n\\npurpose special records must be kept for every piece of equipment.\\n\\nIt is important to emphasize that the licensee, when assuring the quality of the equipment technology, must strictly follow the instruction of the supplier or the manufacturer listed in the accompanying directions and documentation.\\n\\n10.2\\n\\nEquipment Used in Nuclear Medicine\\n\\nThe following equipment is listed in the QAprogramme:\\n\\n1. 2.\\n\\nEquipment measuring activity of radiopharmaceuticals (calibrators); Single-detector equipment for measuring in vitro and in vivo (for for unscintigraphic examination) and multiple-detector equipment measuring in vitro;\\n\\n17\\n\\n3.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nImaging equipment (scintillation planar cameras, scintillation cameras for one-photon emission tomography – SPECT); Equipment for safety dosimetry (measuring equipment for input sources, surface contamination, operation dosimeters).\\n\\nControl of the quality of the activity-measuring instruments (calibrators)\\n\\nwith a well-ionizing chamber:\\n\\nThe consistency tests for calibrators are summarized as: (cid:3)\\n\\nSIMPLE (cid:4) (cid:4)\\n\\nBackground Stability (short term reproducibility)\\n\\n(cid:3)\\n\\nCOMPLICATED (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4)\\n\\nLong term reproducibility Calibration (measuring accuracy) Linearity Measuring geometry\\n\\nOverview of activity tests (calibrators) with the ionizing well chamber and\\n\\nfrequency of their application is shown in the table 2.\\n\\nThe licensee bears the responsibility of accuracy of radionuclide calibrator.As all calibrators show some dependence on measurement geometry that diminishes with increasing depth of the well, the nuclear medicine units will ensure that tables giving correction factors are applied in measurements on different radionuclides in syringes, vials & other containers of different sizes & types are being provided.\\n\\nThe records of QC tests must be maintained and provided to the Authority Inspectors on demand at the time of inspection.

For clinical radionuclides other than Tc, it is important to verify intrinsic uniformity with the appropriate corrections on a regular schedule, the frequency of which will depend on the variety of radionuclides used with a particular system; and\\n\\n99m\\n\\nii.\\n\\nVisual Inspection of Collimators: A visual inspection of collimators should be performed daily & whenever collimators are changed. Signs of denting, scratches, or stains should be followed with an extrinsic flood test & a background check before a suspect collimator is used for patient imaging.\\n\\nLESS FREQUENT TESTS\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nResolution Phantoms: Using a four quadrant bar pattern or some other repetitive pattern, such as holes, resolution & linearity of the entire surface of the camera can be judged. Compare the results with the reference image identically acquired at the time of known performance. Loss of resolution may indicate electronic noise or degradation of crystal or interface; Center of Rotation (COR) Test: COR testing should be performed as per recommended schedule of the manufacturer. It is recommended that COR testing be performed routinely on all collimators used for SPECT. Variable angle cameras should be checked for both the 90 & 180 degree positions, unless otherwise stated by the manufacturer. It is a good practice to look at per-view deviations from expected source positions which can indicate problems with mechanical alignment. It is desirable to rotate collimators systematically for the purpose of this test, so that a different collimator (or collimator set) is used for performing the test until all SPECT collimators have been tested;\\n\\n23\\n\\nTABLE 7: Tests for SPECT QC\\n\\nVARIABLES\\n\\nT N U O C M 5 : Y L A D\\n\\nI\\n\\nD O O L F\\n\\nM U R T C E P S K A E P\\n\\nW E V R E N C\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nW E V E R M A R G O N S\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nT N A R D A U Q 4\\n\\n)\\n\\nN O T U L O S E R\\n\\nI\\n\\n(\\n\\nM O T N A H P\\n\\nF O R E T N E C\\n\\nN O T A T O R\\n\\nI\\n\\nT N U O C H G H\\n\\nI\\n\\nC S N R T N\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nY T M R O F N U\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nM O T N A H P T C E P S\\n\\nD N U O R G K C A B\\n\\nK C E H C\\n\\nK C E H C T L T D A E H\\n\\nI\\n\\nD E T C U R T S N O C E R\\n\\nE C R U O S T N O P\\n\\nI\\n\\nCollimator Damage\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPMT Drift\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy Peak Drift\\n\\n0\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMechanical COR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\nElectronic Noise\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\nCrystal Damage/Coupling Dry\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContamination/Spills\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMagnetic Fields\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\nPower Fluctuations\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\nBackground\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTemperature Fluctuations\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAny Variable As a Function of Angle\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\nKey - 0 +\\n\\nSignifies that the test is unlikely to show sensitivity for the designated variable Signifies some sensitivity for the designated variable Signifies high sensitivity for the designated variable\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nHigh Count Intrinsic Uniformity Flood: High count density intrinsic floods should initially be acquired weekly; afterwards the frequency of the test is adjusted according to the camera\\'s stability. Departments using multiple radionuclides should rotate radionuclides used for this test & compare images to the baseline acquired with the same radionuclide; Tilt Angle of the Camera Head(s): For best results in SPECT, the detector head must be parallel to the axis of rotation (level). For manually positioned systems this must be verified at every acquisition; but even systems with motorized tilt angles need to be checked periodically. Verify that a level detector corresponds to a tilt indication of zero, at different radii of rotation. A change in indicated value will be indicative of mechanical problems; Reconstructed Point Source Resolution: Features to look for in the\\n\\nv.\\n\\nD E T C U R T S N O C E R\\n\\nD O O L F Y T M R O F N U\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n24\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nviii.\\n\\nreconstructed image are: width in all three dimensions, shape & presence of streaking or other artifacts. This test can conveniently be carried out at the same time as a COR test (using the same point source). An offset point source will provide more information about camera performance than a source on axis, but when combining this test with the COR test, follow manufacturers recommendations; Reconstructed Cylindrical Phantom Uniformity: A frequency of once a month is recommended. This test will uncover any angular variations in camera performance that have not been picked up by other tests; SPECT Resolution & Uniformity Phantom Test: This test is recommended for QC purposes. When performed using the recommended phantom, and when acquired correctly, the analysis of the results of this test provides information on the complete SPECT imaging system, both hardware & software. This test may not specifically indicate the source of an error but when used routinely it provides a valuable trend analysis of total system performance. It is recommended that this phantom test be acquired initially at system acceptance and then quarterly thereafter. Results of all subsequent acquisitions should be compared to the baseline acceptance study; and Pixel Size: Pixel size is another parameter that affects SPECT image quality & quantization. This should be monitored more frequently in older SPECT systems. The newer digital cameras should be tested initially upon acceptance & then every six months thereafter following manufacturers\\' instructions.\\n\\nTable No: 8 outlines a summary of recommended SPECT QC Tests. The tests outlined are not performance tests; rather, the outcome of these tests is expected to change as the system performance changes. It is, therefore, important to establish a baseline as an indication of system degradation. Acquisition parameters as well as acceptable deviations will be based on individual manufacturer\\'s recommendations.\\n\\n10.3.1 QAof Equipment for Safety Dosimetry\\n\\n10.3.1.1 Dose and Dose Rate Measuring Device\\n\\nResponse control test: It is the value shown on the equipment when measuring the dose and the dose rate of a known value in the photon radiation field (gamma & roentgen radiation).

The licensee’s definition of URC should, in turn, include the identification of targets whose sabotage could lead to such consequences and should therefore be protected. URC is defined by one or more quantitative measures of dose or radioactive material release that have been established as thresholds (limits).\\n\\nb.\\n\\nHigh Radiological Consequences (HRC)\\n\\nHRC are the potential radiological consequences of sabotage which could potentially result in a substantial radiological release significantly affecting the population and environment beyond the boundaries of nuclear facility. For threshold above or equal to HRC, vital areas need to be identified and protected.\\n\\nc.\\n\\nVital Area\\n\\nRegulation 29(1) of PAK/925 requires that “All equipment, systems or devices, or nuclear material, the sabotage of which could directly or indirectly lead to high radiological consequences should be located inside one or more vital areas.”\\n\\nd.\\n\\nRelationship between URC and HRC\\n\\nThe relationship between URC and HRC and graded levels of protection are\\n\\nrepresented in below Figure-1.\\n\\nFigure-1: Relationship between URC and HRC\\n\\n15\\n\\nThe physical protection\\n\\nrequirements against potential\\n\\nradiological\\n\\nconsequences are as follows:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nIf potential radiological consequences exceed threshold of high radiological consequences, then vital areas should be identified and protected.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nIf potential radiological consequences fall between the thresholds of unacceptable radiological consequences and high radiological consequences, the State will specify graded protection requirements based on the level of potential consequences.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nIf radiological consequences fall below the thresholds of unacceptable radiological consequences, then there may be no specific requirements for physical protection, however, the operator should still secure and control access to safety related equipment and devices.\\n\\ne.\\n\\nCriteria for Graded Protection against Sabotage\\n\\nIn order to apply the graded approach to physical protection against sabotage, Table-1 provides classification of facilities and sabotage targets in terms of potential radiological consequences resulted from sabotage.\\n\\n16\\n\\nTable-1: Criteria for Classification of Facilities\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nClass A\\n\\nClass B\\n\\nClass C\\n\\n1.\\n\\nClassification Facilities, whose\\n\\nFacilities, whose\\n\\nFacilities, whose\\n\\nsabotage could result in severe deterministic effects off-site.\\n\\nsabotage could give rise to doses to people off-site.\\n\\nsabotage could result in doses on- site.\\n\\n[Emergency Preparedness Category I as given in Schedule 1 of PAK/914(Rev.1)]\\n\\n[Emergency Preparedness Category II as given in Schedule 1 of PAK/914 (Rev.1)]\\n\\n[Emergency Preparedness Category III as given in Schedule 1 of PAK/914 (Rev.1)]\\n\\n2.\\n\\nTypes of\\n\\nFacilities\\n\\nNuclear Power Plants\\n\\nFreshly discharge nuclear fuel\\n\\nResearch Reactors (with power levels >2 MW but ≤100 MW)\\n\\nSpent Fuel requiring active cooling.\\n\\nFacilities having Irradiated, depleted or natural uranium, thorium or low enriched fuel (less than 10% fissile content)\\n\\nResearch Reactors (with power levels ≤ 2 MW)\\n\\nFacilities with inventories of radioactive material sufficient to result in doses warranting urgent protective action on-site\\n\\nDry or spent fuel in wet storage with no active cooling\\n\\n3.\\n\\nPhysical\\n\\nProtection\\n\\nLevel\\n\\nClass A facilities should be protected at least in accordance with the requirements of vital area*.\\n\\nClass B facilities should be protected at least in accordance with the requirements of protected area*.\\n\\nClass C facilities should be protected at least in accordance with the requirements of limited access area*.\\n\\nVital, protected and limited areas, as defined in PAK/925\\n\\n17\\n\\nEVENT REPORTING FORM\\n\\n18\\n\\nANNEXURE-II\\n\\n19\\n\\nnrecc@pnra.org\\n\\n20\\n\\nPAKISTAN NUCLEAR REGULATORY AUTHORITY P.O.

Box 1912, Islamabad www.pnra.org\\n\\nRADIATION SAFETY IN INDUSTRIAL RADIOGRAPHY\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nIndustrial radiography is of significant importance in non destructive testing. It involves application of ionizing radiations e.g. X-rays and gamma rays to verify the physical integrity of items, equipment and structures such as vessels, pipes, welded joints, casting and other devices. Industrial radiography poses negligible risk if it is performed in a safe manner. However, experience shows that incidents involving industrial radiography sources have sometimes resulted in high doses to workers, causing severe health consequences such as radiation burns and, in a few cases, death. Members of the public have also suffered radiation overexposures when radioactive sources used for industrial radiography are not properly controlled or regulated. All such incidents demonstrate the necessity to have effective radiation safety infrastructure in place within the facilities; complemented with strong regulatory oversight to ensure highest level of safety. In order to control/eliminate such incidents in radiation facilities, PNRA has established requirements in the form of regulations called \"Regulations on Radiation Protection\" (PAK/904). This regulatory guide provides guidance to the licensee(s) and worker(s) to fulfill the purpose of these regulations effectively.\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nINTRODUCTION

in medicine, industry, agriculture and research. One of the foremost industrial applications of such radiation is the use of sources to verify the physical integrity of items, equipment and structures through non-destructive testing. The structural integrity of such equipment and structures affects not only the safety and quality of the products but also the protection of the workers, public and the environment.\\n\\nRadiography is a process in which radiation passes through an object/material under investigation and strikes at photographic film or some other digital detection system placed behind it. There is a partial absorption of the radiation beam as it passes through the object/material and it gives the detailed information in the form of final image on a photographic film or a digital detection system as illustrated in Figure 1.\\n\\nFigure 1 : Radiography Process\\n\\nThe ionizing radiation such as high energy gamma and X-rays are used for industrial radiography purposes worldwide because of their significant penetrating power. Apart from X- ray generators, examples of sealed radioactive sources (SRS) emitting gamma rays, used in industrial radiography, include Cobalt (Co-60), Iridium (Ir-192) and Cesium (Cs-137) etc.\\n\\nIndustrial radiography usually produces high doses and if a person is accidentally exposed to primary beam or comes in close contact with an unshielded radiography source (i.e. SRS), he might receive a dose that could result in severe deterministic health effects. Therefore, it requires high degree of professionalism which can only be achieved through effective management system, compliance with regulatory requirements, regulatory oversight and effective training/re-training of radiographers. A need to provide guidance to the licensee(s) of industrial radiography facilities, has been felt since long, to facilitate them in complying with the requirements regarding radiation protection. This regulatory guide has been prepared on the bases of the requirements established under regulation(s) 9, 10, 20, 25 to\\n\\n1\\n\\n30, 32 and 33 of \"Regulations on Radiation Protection\" - PAK/904 [1]. Moreover, guidance on the implementation of requirements of relevant regulation(s) of \"Regulations on Management of a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency\" - PAK/914 [2] and \"Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material\" - PAK/916 [3] have also been provided in this guide.\\n\\n2 OBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance to licensee(s) and worker(s)\\n\\nregarding radiation safety in industrial radiography.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThe guidance provided in this regulatory guide is applicable to the licensee(s) using radiation source(s) (i.e. SRS emitting gamma rays and X-ray generators) for the purpose of industrial radiography whether performed in a shielded enclosure or in a partially closed or open site.\\n\\n4\\n\\nDUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\\n\\nThe overall responsibility for radiation safety lies with the licensee.

Ensure that the requirements for safe transport of radiography sources are met.\\n\\n[4] 4.3 Responsibilities of Radiography Crew\\n\\nThe radiography crew is composed of operators/radiographers qualified and certified for conducting radiography operations. The crew is usually lead by a senior radiographer and assisted by other crew members. A senior radiographer (supervisor) should have the following responsibilities:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nEnsure that the crew is familiar with the basic knowledge of radiation protection;\\n\\n4\\n\\nii. Be familiar with radiography equipment and its use, approved working rules and applicable routine/emergency procedures and operate the equipment in accordance with approved procedures/working rules;\\n\\niii.

Ensure that the operation of radiography equipment is immediately stopped, by returning the source (i.e. SRS) to its fully shielded position, in the following circumstances: a. If malfunction occurs during radiography operation; b. If any person other than the radiography crew enters an area where the dose rate\\n\\nexceeds or might exceed the allowable regulatory limits;\\n\\nx.\\n\\nc. If the only available survey meter fails to function. Promptly take appropriate measures, in accordance with the approved emergency procedure, to bring the situation under control in the event of a radiation incident.\\n\\nThe assisting crew members should bear the following responsibilities:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nCarry out the duties/tasks as are assigned/delegated by the supervisor, in accordance with the established local rules;\\n\\nii. Operate radiography equipment only under the direct supervision of concerned\\n\\nsupervisor;\\n\\niii. Take over the responsibilities insofar, in the event of a supervisor being unable to\\n\\n5\\n\\ncarry out his duties, by ensuring the exposure to himself and other crew members remains within the regulatory limits.\\n\\n5\\n\\n[1] INDIVIDUAL MONITORING\\n\\nIndividual monitoring is a measure of radiation dose(s) to individual(s) for the estimation of exposure to radiation and the interpretation of corresponding results. Licensee/owner should ensure that radiation doses to radiography crew are assessed on regular intervals to ensure that doses are kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) and are below the limits of PAK/904.\\n\\nIndividual monitoring is recommended for the individual(s) who routinely work in a controlled area. It provides information about the magnitude and pattern of doses received by an individual. Such information is important for a number of reasons; which are described below:\\n\\ni. ii. iii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nIt enables to exercise control over radiation exposure of an individual; It demonstrates whether doses are being kept ALARA; It contributes to highlight unexpected high doses; enables to investigate the circumstances of overexposure; and helps to determine corrective actions to be taken, if necessary; It indicates the efficacy of radiation protection measures applied during routine work practices and measure improvement and/or deterioration in current work practices; It also highlights good or bad work practices, status of radiography equipment, and degradation of shielding or engineered safety systems.\\n\\nThe ultimate choice of the type of dosimeter, to be used by the radiographers, should be made by the RPO in consultation with a qualified expert in radiation dosimetry, if possible. In addition to fulfill various technical requirements, the parameters such as its availability, initial/running cost, its robustness, and applicable regulatory requirements should also be considered while choosing a specific dosimeter.\\n\\n5.1 Types of Dosimeters\\n\\nDosimeter is an instrument used for recording radiation dose to an individual. Dosimeters are used not only during routine working in a radiation area but are also used in the event of an emergency or an incident. There are two types of dosimeter which can be used for a short-term as well as for routine dose monitoring. These dosimeters are classified as active dosimeters and passive dosimeters. Necessary detail regarding these dosimeters is given below:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nActive or direct-reading dosimeters are used for short-term (from minutes up to few hours) dose assessment and provide an instantaneous dose and/or alarm at pre-set dose levels or dose-rate. These can be very useful in restricting exposures during\\n\\n6\\n\\nindustrial radiography. The examples of direct reading dosimeters are Pen Dosimeters and Electronic Personal Dosimeters (EPD). Pen Dosimeters are always used after calibration through its calibrator. Active dosimeters are intended to be used for providing real time indication of the dose being received during radiography and/or for providing a warning for high dose-rate. Common measuring range of such dosimeters is from one (1) µSv/hr to 100 mSv/hr.\\n\\nŸ Dosimeters used for routine monitoring are referred as passive dosimeters i.e. they require to be processed by a specialized dosimetry service provider, on periodic intervals, to assess the dose received by an individual. Examples of passive dosimeters used for dose assessment due to beta, gamma, X-rays and neutron radiations are Film Badges (FB) and Thermo-Luminescent Dosimeters (TLD). It is preferable to get such dosimeters (FB/TLD) read from an accredited dosimetry service provider on monthly basis for the assessment of dose received by the worker(s).\\n\\nFigure -2 given below, illustrate the examples of various types of (active and passive)\\n\\ndosimeters.\\n\\nPen Dosimeter\\n\\nCalibrator\\n\\nEPD\\n\\nFilm Badge\\n\\nTLD\\n\\nFigure 2: Types of Dosimeters\\n\\n5.2 Precautions for Dosimeter(s)\\n\\nTo ensure that a dosimeter provides an accurate assessment of the dose(s) to a\\n\\nradiographer, following guidelines should be followed:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nDosimeter(s) should be worn (only) by the radiographer, to whom it is issued; It should be worn at all times, when carrying out work with radiation;\\n\\n7\\n\\niii.\\n\\nIt should preferably be worn on chest or belt or in accordance with the recommendations of dosimetry service provider; It should be worn on inside of the apron, in case if lead apron is used during work;\\n\\niv. v. Whenever, hands are exposed to radiation, ring dosimeters should be worn facing\\n\\ntowards inside of the hand;\\n\\nvi. The measuring element should be correctly positioned in the dosimeter holder,\\n\\nboth for TLD and FB;\\n\\nvii. Care should be taken to avoid damaging the measuring element of the dosimeter because of their sensitivity (i.e. dosimeters must be protected against water, high temperature/pressure and physical impact);\\n\\nviii. It should not be exposed to radiation when not being worn by a radiographer (it\\n\\nshould be stored in an area away from radiation sources);\\n\\nix. Dosimeter(s) (TLD/FB) should be immediately sent for processing by the\\n\\ndosimetry service provider after the end of each term;\\n\\nx. Damaged dosimeter should not be used. If a radiographer suspects that the dosimeter is damaged or is exposed to radiation when not in use, RPO should be informed accordingly;\\n\\nxi. The RPO should inform PNRA and the dosimetry service provider about the lost or\\n\\ndamaged dosimeters and its replacement should be arranged as soon as possible.\\n\\n5.3 Unusual Dose\\n\\nRadiation doses received by radiographers are expected to be low, usually not exceeding 2-3 mSv in a year, provided that all safety measures/procedures are implemented. However, if an unusual high dose, e.g. several mSv in a year, is reported for a single dosimeter or radiographer then it is not usual and should not go un-checked. It might be the result of high workload, a maintenance activity or enactment of an emergency plan. It also indicates poor work practices or inadequate radiation protection arrangements by the licensee. Such deficiencies, if confirmed, should be rectified and reason(s) for any unusual dose should be investigated by the licensee/RPO. Records of such investigations should be maintained and PNRA should be informed accordingly.\\n\\n5.4\\n\\nInvestigation Levels\\n\\nPNRA Regulations on Radiation Protection (PAK/904) require that the licensee should establish investigation levels of dose(s) to individual(s). Such investigation levels are specific values of dose which, if exceeded, requires to be investigated. The purpose of such investigation is to determine the circumstances that gave rise to higher dose(s) and to make a judgment whether this dose is as low as reasonably achievable or not. It is important to note that the numerical value of a dose investigation level, established by the licensee, is always a fraction of a particular dose limit.\\n\\n8\\n\\nSuch investigation levels and corresponding actions to be taken, in the event of these being exceeded, may also be established by the Authority. Although, they are not regulatory binding, however, their use as means of ensuring safety of workers should not be ignored.\\n\\n5.5 Over Exposure\\n\\nAn overexposure is considered to have occurred when a particular dose limit, specified by PNRA, has been exceeded. Overexposure is most likely to occur as a result of an incident or accident. An individual or a radiographer who suspects that he had an overexposure, should immediately inform the RPO/Licensee. In case of an overexposure, the RPO/Licensee should immediately inform PNRA and carry out a detailed investigation to determine the reasons, including an assessment of dose(s) received by the individual/radiographer, and final conclusion thereof. The report of such investigation should be submitted to PNRA, as soon as possible. PNRA may also conduct further investigations, if so required.\\n\\n5.6 Health Surveillance\\n\\nThe Licensee/owner should develop and execute a program for health surveillance of workers and should make necessary arrangements for their health surveillance [1]. Initial health surveillance should be performed to assess whether a worker possesses an adequate level of fitness for the intended tasks and that he/she is psychologically suitable to work with radiation source(s). Whereas, the licensee/owner should make arrangements for annual health surveillance (medical examination) of the workers working in a controlled area to ensure that their health remains satisfactory. Such program should be based on general principles of occupational health as described in \"Factories Act 1934\" currently enforced in Pakistan.\\n\\n6 GAMMA RADIOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT\\n\\n[5]\\n\\nHigh activity sealed radioactive source(s), housed in a shielded exposure device, are commonly used in gamma radiography equipment. The source remains in the shielded exposure device unless used. It is exposed by remotely moving it from the shielded exposure device (e.g. by using push–pull wires) directly into an attached guide tube. It remains in the guide tube for the desired exposure time, after which it is drawn back into the shielded exposure device.\\n\\nThe equipment used for gamma radiography typically consists of several components such as a remote wind-out mechanism (often called a crank), connected to the radiography source (often called a \\'pigtail\\') inside a shielded exposure device, which is directly connected to the guide tube. Sealed sources used for gamma radiography are normally part of a source assembly (the pigtail) that is usually connected to the drive cable in source projection type systems. The design and operation of these various components of gamma radiography equipment are interrelated.\\n\\nGamma radiography equipment should be selected in a way to ensure uninterrupted\\n\\n9\\n\\noperation during radiography. Following features should be considered while selection of gamma radiography equipment:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nIt should be durable i.e. resistant to corrosion, radiation and high temperature; It should be capable to prevent the passage of water, sand and other foreign materials into its critical parts.\\n\\n6.1 Exposure Device\\n\\nThe exposure device (also called as gamma projector) incorporates various safety devices and features designed to reduce the risk of human error or equipment malfunction. The licensee/owner should ensure to use an exposure device that has been designed in compliance with the applicable international standards to ensure that minimum safety requirements are met and that the device and source combination is suitable for use for radiography purposes. It should be ensured that an appropriate source with maximum activity permitted is used in the exposure device (quoted for each radionuclide) for which it is designed. Since, design specifications of most exposure devices also meet the requirements for a Type B(U) transport package as specified in PNRA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material - PAK/916, therefore, these can also be used as transport package for the transportation of radiography source(s).\\n\\nEach exposure device (gamma projector), as illustrated in Figure-3, should be\\n\\npermanently and clearly labeled with the following details:\\n\\ni. Radiation warning sign (trefoil) and the word “RADIOACTIVE”; ii. Name of radionuclide and its maximum activity for which it is designed; iii. Name of radionuclide (SRS) in use, its serial number, activity along with reference\\n\\ndate;\\n\\niv. Type of container i.e. B(U) or B(M); v.\\n\\nLicensee\\'s name, address and contact number(s) for emergency situation.\\n\\nThe exposure device should have a locking mechanism. The locking should be designed on the principle of \"fail-to-lock\", if the source is not in its secured position. It should have an indicator to show whether the device is locked or not. The exposure device should be of such design that the source can only be moved, from its secured position, by a remote control (crank). When the source is in secured position, dose rate should not exceed 2 mSv/h on the\\n\\nFigure 3: Exposure Device (Gamma Projector)\\n\\n10\\n\\nsurface of the device and 0.01 mSv/h at a distance of one meter from the surface of the device. The remote control (crank) should also be capable to indicate clearly whether the source is in secured position or in exposed/working position.\\n\\n6.2 Drive Cable and Guide Tube\\n\\nAncillary equipment such as drive cable and guide tube are used to maximize the distance between the radiographer and source i.e. SRS. It has to be ensured that drive cable and guide tube are capable to withstand with the stresses caused during the use of gamma projector. Connections between the drive cable and source, and among the lengths/pieces of guide tube should be of such design that source can move freely when connections are properly made. The source should not become loose or stuck in the guide tube. It should be ensured that guide tube and openings of the exposure device are provided with covers to prevent dust from entering into the device.\\n\\n6.3 Recommendations for the Use of Drive Cable and Guide Tube\\n\\nLicensee should ensure to use such gamma radiography equipment and accessories i.e.\\n\\ndrive cable and guide tube which comply with the following recommendations:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nSuch guide tube should be used through which the source can move freely . Design of the end cap at exposure end of the guide tube should prevent inadvertent release of the source when it is fully projected; Open end of the guide tube should be caped to prevent ingress of dirt, grit and moisture and, if it is flexible, it should withstand repeated flexures without suffering permanent distortion. It should be capable to recover from any temporary distortion caused by a compressive load or flexure; Exposure end of the guide tube should be clamped in position during exposure without affecting free movement of cable and source, and should be fitted with a collimator;\\n\\niv. Where a cable is used to move the source, the coupling should ensure that during\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nradiography work, the source (or pigtail) is not detached inadvertently; Drive cable should typically be 7-15 m and the guide tubes should be 2–6.5 m long according to the actual conditions of exposure to ensure that source is controlled from a location where dose rate is minimum; The radiographer must know the distance through which the source is projected from its fully shielded position, through the wind out mechanism; In case the source is moved pneumatically, the guide tube should be provided with damping mechanisms, at both ends, to protect the source from damage.\\n\\n6.4 Collimators\\n\\nCollimators are beam limiting devices and are used to narrow/direct the beam of radiations in a particular direction. Radiographers should ensure that collimators are used, whenever possible, to reduce radiation levels and subsequent doses. Collimators are usually\\n\\n11\\n\\nmade of lead, tungsten or depleted uranium, and they can provide either panoramic or directional beams. The licensee should ensure that the collimators are compatible with the source assembly, so as to avoid the source to be stuck.\\n\\n6.5\\n\\nInstructions for Testing and Maintenance of Radiography Equipment\\n\\nThe maintenance consists of complete disassembly of the equipment and a detailed inspection of all the components. Worn or damaged parts should be replaced, wherever required, and suitable lubricant should be applied. The licensee should develop and implement a program for periodic testing/surveillance and preventive maintenance of radiography equipment and its accessories in the light of manufacturer\\'s instructions. It should be ensured that only vendor or specially trained radiographer(s) always perform testing/maintenance of radiography equipment. Records of all maintenance, including the replacement of parts, should be kept.\\n\\nPeriodic testing/surveillance of the following typical items/devices should be\\n\\nconsidered in the program:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nExposure device, to ensure that: a. Fittings and fasteners are tight; b. Locking mechanism functions properly; c. Radiation levels are normal; d. Connections of guide tube and remote control (crank) are secure; e. Pigtail connection to drive cable is secured, using a wear gauge. Remote control (crank) and guide tube(s), to ensure that: a. Fittings are tight; b. There are no indications of crushing, kinks or dents; c. Drive cable can move freely; d. Source (pigtail) tips are not worn through.\\n\\niii. Safety interlock components and emergency stop devices of shielded\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nenclosure(s), to ensure their normal operation; Inspection of critical safety components of radiography equipment and its accessories, at least once a year; Leak test of SRS as per method and frequency recommended by the source vendor or manufacturer.\\n\\n7\\n\\nX- RAY RADIOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT\\n\\n[4]\\n\\nThe most common type of X-ray generator used as radiography equipment is the conventional X-ray Tube; however, Linear Accelerators (LINACs) and Cyclotrons are also used in few specialized applications. Some typical examples of X-ray generators are illustrated in Figure-4.\\n\\n12\\n\\nFigure 4: X-ray Generator used for Industrial Radiography\\n\\nX-ray generators are mostly used for performing panoramic (radial beam) and\\n\\ndirectional exposures. The X-ray tube is connected by a cable to the control panel, which provides means for pre-selection and indication of operating parameters. Dose to a radiographer can be affected by the cable length, operating parameters (volts-kV and current- mA) and local shielding around the device being radiographed. Licensee should only use such X-ray generators that satisfy the following minimum safety standards.\\n\\n7.1 Electrical Safety\\n\\nElectrical safety in an X-ray generator indirectly contributes to radiation safety, since electrical faults in X-ray generators can sometimes result in serious accidents with radiological consequences. In particular, all metallic items including casings, interconnecting cables, power supply unit (transformer/generator), control equipment, tube assembly, warning signals, other safety devices should be electrically bonded together (earth bonding) and connected to earth (grounded). Advice on all electrical matters, as well as on inspection and testing, should be obtained from a qualified electrical engineer or specialized service engineer, if required.\\n\\n7.2 Cable Length\\n\\nWhere radiography cannot be carried out in a shielded enclosure, cable lengths should typically be not less than 20 meters for X-ray generators up to 300 kV and longer for higher energy equipment.\\n\\n7.3 Collimators and Beam Filters\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that the X-ray generators used for directional radiography should, wherever practicable, be fitted with collimators (sometimes called cones or diaphragms) to limit the beam size to the minimum compatible with the radiographic technique. Beam filters should be used to match the filtration with the work being undertaken.\\n\\n13\\n\\n7.4 Control Panel\\n\\nThe licensee should consider following features in a control panel while selecting an X-\\n\\nray equipment. It should bear:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nA label incorporating radiation warning sign (trefoil), a legend indicating that X- rays are emitted when the equipment is operating and a warning label (in a local language) prohibiting unauthorized use;\\n\\nii. A key switch to prevent unauthorized use of equipment. The key should be removable only when the switch is in \\'OFF\\' or \\'Standby\\' position (i.e. it should not be possible to lock the system in \\'ON\\' condition). Key positions should be clearly marked;\\n\\niii. A labeled warning light (fail-safe) which indicates that the equipment is\\n\\npowered/energized (i.e. ready to emit X-rays);\\n\\niv. A separate labeled warning light (fail-safe) which indicates that the equipment is\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nactually emitting X-rays; A timer that controls the exposure duration or \\'ON\\' switch that requires continuous pressure by a radiographer to maintain the generation of X-rays; Indicators that show the kilovolts (kV) and the current in milli-amperes (mA) when the X-ray beam is \\'ON\\';\\n\\nvii. A clearly labeled means to immediately terminate the generation of radiation.\\n\\n7.5 X-ray Tube Head\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that the X-ray tube head is supported in a suitable stand or clamped in a position to prevent it from inadvertently moving. Leakage radiation (i.e. leakage that passes through the sides of the device rather than pass from the beam aperture) should be restricted by good design and construction and its level should be specified by the manufacturer. The penetrating power of leakage radiation depends on the kilo voltage and is particularly significant above 500 kV. Maximum dose rates due to leakage radiation at the surface of the device and at one (1) meter from the X ray target should be obtained from the manufacturer/vendor. Typical maximum dose rate values from leakage radiation arising from commercial X-ray tubes are up to 100 μSv/h at one (1) meter from the target.\\n\\n7.6 Flash X-ray Units\\n\\nSome X-ray based radiography equipment emit very short pulses of X-rays and the exposure duration is set in terms of number of pulses. Such radiography equipment are called flash X-ray units. These are often small, portable, battery driven units and are mainly used for the radiography of items of low density or very low wall thickness. Whereas, large such units are less often used in shielded enclosures where high output and extremely short exposure is required. The licensee should apply the same precautions that are used for ordinary X-ray equipment along with any additional safety precautions as determined on the bases of dose assessment. Most survey/dose meters are not suitable for the measurement of dose around flash X-ray units because exposure duration is extremely short and their response time is\\n\\n14\\n\\nrelatively slow. Therefore, it is advisable to use suitable integrating survey/dose meters.\\n\\n7.7\\n\\nInspection, Testing and Maintenance of X-ray Equipment\\n\\nIn order to ensure continued radiography operations, the licensee should arrange both; the routine surveillance as well as formal inspections/maintenance of X-ray equipment (including all accessories) to be performed by the manufacturer/vendor or a qualified engineer. Licensee should ensure that equipment is not modified without prior assessment of the implications of the modification on its original design and the safety assessment. Any parts to be replaced should be procured from the authorized merchant in order to ensure designed safety specifications/parameters.\\n\\nThe licensee should perform following periodic surveillance activities for their X-ray\\n\\nequipment:\\n\\nChecks to ensure electrical safety i.e. earth bonding and electrical insulation of cables; ii. Cleaning/replacing of filters, if any, of cooling system(s); iii. Checks to ensure there is no leakage from the X-ray tube head; iv. Checks to ensure that cables are in good working condition and wires are not\\n\\ni.\\n\\nfrayed/exposed; Tests on interlocks and emergency cut-out switches;\\n\\nv. vi. Tests on permanently installed radiation detectors inside radiography enclosures; vii. Any other tests and maintenance as recommended by the manufacturer/vendor.\\n\\nThe licensee should establish, maintain and implement a program for maintenance of the equipment. It should be ensured that only manufacturer/vendor or specifically trained operator(s) perform such maintenance. The maintenance should be performed at least once per year or more, if the equipment is used in severe environmental conditions, such as excessive dirt, extreme humidity or is frequently moved within/outside the premises. Non- functioning or damaged parts of the equipment should be replaced at the earliest, whenever necessary. Record(s) of all maintenance activities, including replacement of parts, should be maintained and made available during the inspection(s).\\n\\n8\\n\\nTYPES OF INDUSTRIAL RADIOGRAPHY\\n\\nIndustrial radiography is carried out under a variety of exposure conditions. The radiography, with respect to exposure conditions, is generally classified into two categories i.e. radiography in a shielded enclosure (specially designed exposure room/bunker) and a site radiography (performed in the field or in a client\\'s premises). Owner/Licensee is responsible to ensure protection of workers, public and the environment, in both the exposure situations. In addition to the responsibilities as specified in Section 4.1, following recommendations should also be implemented during both types of radiography activities:\\n\\n8.1 Recommendations for Shielded Enclosure\\n\\n[4,5]\\n\\nA shielded enclosure is an enclosed space specially designed and engineered to provide\\n\\n15\\n\\nadequate shielding against ionizing radiations to the workers and other individuals in the vicinity. The enclosure should be designed to keep all, direct and scattered, radiations arising from radiographic exposures within itself by permitting operation of radiography equipment, from outside, by a remote means (i.e. crank or a control panel). It should incorporate engineering controls to prevent or to minimize the potential exposure of workers who might enter the enclosure when the source(s) (i.e. SRS or an X-ray generator) is exposed or energized. The licensee should ensure that industrial radiography is always performed inside a shielded enclosure, whenever it is reasonably practicable. No one should remain inside the enclosure during exposure. Following precautions should be taken for the radiography performed in a shielded enclosure:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nThe bunker should be constructed in a way that the doors/ports, walls, floor and the ceiling, form a complete shielded enclosure; The shielding should be sufficient to ensure that during exposure; instantaneous dose rate outside the enclosure should be in the range of 2.5 - 20 Sv/hr at one (1) foot from the walls;\\n\\niii. Shielding and the location of enclosure should be such that no worker or a member of public should receive an effective dose in excess of 5 mSv and 1 mSv per year respectively from exposures carried out within it;\\n\\niv. There should be a single access point for the radiography enclosure with a warning notice/sign displayed at it. A warning light should also be provided capable of illuminating during exposure and visible from outside the enclosure; Interlocks should be installed at the access point of the enclosure capable of activating a visible and audible alarm if any interlock is opened/bypassed during the exposure;\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi. Door and panels covering access apertures into the enclosure should overlap with those apertures by a sufficient margin to prevent any leakage of radiations from the enclosure. Where a maze is used for the access, a lockable door or barrier connected to an interlock should be provided;\\n\\nvii. Since, dose rates are very high inside the enclosure, during radiography work, therefore, it should be designated as a controlled area. However, it is not required to be designated as a controlled area when it is not in use;\\n\\nviii. The enclosure should be designed in such a way that there should be no controlled area outside it. However, the area surrounding the shielded enclosure might be designated as a supervised area, if situation warrants.\\n\\n8.2 Recommendations for Site Radiography\\n\\n[4]\\n\\nA great deal of industrial radiography operations are performed without any shielded enclosure due to economy, convenience and practical necessity. Such radiography is called as site radiography. Particular care should be exercised, during site radiography, to avoid unnecessary exposure of workers and individuals in the vicinity and to keep all the exposures as low as reasonably achievable. Collimators should be used to the extent practicable to restrict the radiation beam to the object being radiographed.\\n\\n16\\n\\nThe licensee is responsible to implement following precautions for the radiography\\n\\nperformed in an open site:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nBefore undertaking site/field radiography, appropriate working rules should be established and adhered to at all times;\\n\\nii. A set of site working rules should be available at site and the radiography crew should ensure that they are familiar with such rules that apply to planned exposure situations. Any modifications or additional rules to meet the particular situation should be developed in consultation with the RPO;\\n\\niii. Before commencing radiography in an open site/field, a well-defined and clearly visible boundary should be established using warning signs, barriers, flagged rope, etc. The boundary should be located such that the calculated dose rate at the boundary during exposure should not exceed the regulatory limit of 10 µSv/hr. Actual dose rate at the boundary should be measured during exposure using a survey meter and location of the boundary should be rectified as necessary before subsequent exposures; The boundaries of adjacent sites/fields should not overlap each other. If overlap is unavoidable; close liaison should be maintained between radiography crew responsible for the adjacent sites to avoid accidental exposure; Control panel (or crank) should be placed at such a location that the dose rate remains as low as reasonably achievable. During exposure, the radiographer, whenever possible, should move quickly to a location where the dose rate does not exceed the regulatory limit of 25 µSv/hr. The dose rate at the control panel, if occupied, or at the position taken up by the radiographer during exposure should be checked regularly by using a survey meter; Immediate surroundings of the exposure device should be clearly visible from the control panel and from the position taken up by the radiographer during exposure. The area inside the delineated boundary of an open site/field should be inspected, prior to exposure, to ensure that no worker or an individual is inside it. It should be kept under observation at all the times during exposure to ensure that no one enters into it;\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii. Appropriate warning light(s) and an audible alarm located immediately adjacent to the exposure device should be used to indicate that an exposure is underway; viii. Megaphone should also be made available to warn people in the vicinity not to\\n\\nenter the demarked area.\\n\\n9\\n\\n[1] AREA CLASSIFICATION AND LOCAL RULES\\n\\nAn area in which work involving radiation source(s) is undertaken is called radiation area. It is required to be specifically classified on the bases of potential for exposure to workers and individuals working in that area. It is classified into two types namely; controlled area and supervised area.\\n\\n9.1 Controlled Area\\n\\nThe licensee should make arrangements to designate a radiation area as a controlled area\\n\\n17\\n\\nwhere specific protective measures or safety provisions are required for:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nControlling normal exposures; Preventing or limiting the extent of any potential exposures.\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that the area where there is a likelihood of receiving an effective dose exceeding 6 mSv/year (i.e. 0.69 μSv/hr) or 3/10th of the annual dose limit is designated as a controlled area.\\n\\n9.2 Recommendations for Controlled Area\\n\\nThe licensee is responsible to ensure that followings recommendations are followed by\\n\\nthe radiation workers while working in a controlled area:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nA controlled area should be physically delineated. The radiation warning signs and notices clearly stating “controlled area” should be prominently displayed at all access points; Access to controlled areas should be restricted to authorized persons only. The degree of restriction should be commensurate with the magnitude and likelihood of potential exposures;\\n\\niii. Workplace monitoring should be carried out all around the controlled area. Suitable dose rate monitors (with measuring range from µSv/hr to mSv/hr) should be used for this purpose;\\n\\niv. Arrangements should be made for calibration and testing of radiation monitoring instruments at regular intervals (preferably on annual basis); or as recommended by the Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory (SSDL) or any other certified service provider; Local rules should be strictly followed, at all times, during the work in a controlled area.\\n\\nv.\\n\\n9.3 Supervised Area\\n\\nThe licensee should make arrangements to designate a radiation area as a supervised area where occupational exposure conditions are required to be kept under review. Even though specific protection measures and safety provisions are not normally applied in a supervised area, however, exposure conditions should be kept under review.\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that an area where there is a likelihood of receiving an effective dose exceeding one (1) mSv/year (i.e. 0.11 μSv/hr) or equivalent dose greater than 1/10th of the annual dose limit is designated as a supervised area.\\n\\nUsually, all the delineated areas are controlled areas, rather than a supervised area, in industrial radiography. Supervised areas mostly exist in case of a radiography in a shielded enclosure (room/bunker) rather than the site/field radiography. For example, the area where the control panel is situated outside a shielded enclosure may often be classified as a supervised area.\\n\\n18\\n\\n9.4 Recommendations for Supervised Area\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that followings recommendations are followed by workers\\n\\nwhile working in a supervised area:\\n\\ni. ii. Appropriate radiation warning signs should be posted at all access points; iii.\\n\\nThe extent of supervised area should also be delineated;\\n\\nPeriodic dose-rate monitoring should be carried out in and around the supervised area to ensure that working conditions are kept under review; Established local rules should be followed during the work in a supervised area.\\n\\niv.\\n\\n9.5 Local Rules\\n\\nLocal rules are a set of instructions that specify the manner in which the work should be carried out to ensure adequate level of protection of worker. All industrial radiography work should be carried out in accordance with a set of established local rules. It is responsibility of the licensee to establish local rules and ensure their implementation during radiography work. The licensee should ensure that these local rules describe their organizational structure and the procedures to be followed in a radiation area. These should be set down in writing preferably in local language and should be made available to all the workers involved in radiography. The format and detailed content of local rules may vary among the organizations depending on the type of radiography being undertaken and circumstances of work, however, it should include the following as a minimum:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nIdentification of individual(s) responsible for supervision of work along with their names and designations;\\n\\nii. Description of all controlled and supervised areas. For radiography in a shielded enclosure this may be specific to the premises where the work is carried out. However, for site radiography this may be a general description of conditions under which controlled or supervised areas are considered to exist;\\n\\niii. General radiation safety procedures and instructions on how work should be\\n\\ncarried out in order to keep the exposure minimum;\\n\\niv. Value of dose investigation level (set by the Licensee/RPO) and corresponding\\n\\nv.\\n\\nactions/procedures to be followed in the event of that level being exceede Emergency plan describing actions to be taken in the event of any reasonably foreseeable incident or accident.\\n\\n10 STORAGE OF RADIOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT AND SOURCES\\n\\n[5]\\n\\nThe licensee should ensure that the place where the radiography equipment and the\\n\\nsources (i.e. SRS and X-ray generators) are stored, fulfill the following recommendations:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nRadiography equipment should be kept in a room that is not used for any purpose other than for the storage of radiography equipment and its accessories;\\n\\n19\\n\\nii.\\n\\nThe storage room should be constructed with the material of sufficient durability and strength to resist fire and unauthorized entry;\\n\\niii. The dose rate outside the storage room should be as low as reasonably achievable and it should be ensured that dose rate inside it is less than 2.5 μSv/h, or any member of public will not receive dose exceeding one (1) mSv per year; The storage room should be under the control of a responsible person (e.g. RPO) designated by the licensee and should be kept locked except when removing or replacing the radiography equipment and/or sources; The log-book for the issuance of keys should be maintained;\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv. vi. The storage room should have a conspicuous notice bearing the word “CAUTION” and a radiation warning sign indicating that it is storage for radiography equipment and sources;\\n\\nvii. The notice, or a separate but adjacent notice, should contain instructions for\\n\\ncontacting the responsible person (i.e. RPO) in case of an emergency;\\n\\nviii. The storage room should not be located in proximity to explosives, combustible,\\n\\nix.\\n\\ncorrosive materials, or undeveloped photographic films; Physical security of storage room should also be ensured. The storage room should have only one access door, so that it may not be used as a thorough fare.\\n\\n11 TRANSPORT OF RADIOGRAPHY SOURCES\\n\\n[3]\\n\\nThe deliberate physical movement of radioactive material from one place to another is called transport. PNRA Regulations on Transport of Radioactive Material - PAK/916 assign responsibilities to individuals involved in transport of radioactive materials. These individuals include:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nThe consignor (a person or organization that prepares a consignment for transport); The carrier (the person or organization that undertakes transport of radioactive material); and\\n\\niii. The consignee (the person or organization that receives a consignment).\\n\\nIn many cases, for site radiography work, the licensee itself is responsible to perform all\\n\\nthree functions and is required to discharge the responsibilities associated with each function.\\n\\nFor the transportation of a radioactive material (i.e. radiography sources) within or\\n\\noutside the premises, the licensee is responsible to ensure the following:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nRadiation monitoring should be conducted before, during and after the transportation to verify that the source is in a shielded position;\\n\\nii. When radiography sources are to be moved within a site, for radiography work, they should be kept in the storage facility until they are ready to move to a new location. Ancillary equipment should be disconnected from the devices, and all required plugs and caps should be installed prior to movement;\\n\\n20\\n\\niii. The sources should be moved only in packages (i.e. exposure devices), and these should be locked and keys should be removed. If a vehicle or trolley is used to move the package, the package should be stowed or securely fastened to the vehicle or trolley so as to prevent any shift under any transport incident. The exposure devices should be kept under surveillance for the duration of movement on work location;\\n\\niv. When sources are to be transported to another work location, for the purpose of site radiography, they should be kept in a designated storage facility until they are moved to a new location. All ancillary equipment should be disconnected and all required plugs and caps should be installed prior to transport; The licensee should ensure that the transport and the transport packages comply with the requirements of PAK/916. Where applicable, binding international instruments (i.e. codes and standards) for specific modes of transport e.g. by air or sea, should also be considered;\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi. The package containing radiography source should be placed in a vehicle in such a way that the maximum dose rate for any person traveling in the vehicle shall not exceed 20 µSv/h;\\n\\nvii. The compartment where such package is stowed should be locked and it should not be left unattended, if placed in the back of an open vehicle, at any time during the transport;\\n\\nviii. Special arrangements for security of radiography sources, during transport,\\n\\nshould also be made.\\n\\n11.1 Actions Following Loss of or Damage to a Package During Transport\\n\\nIf the package containing a radiography source is damaged or appears to be damaged\\n\\nduring transport, the licensee/owner should immediately take following actions:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nPerson(s) responsible for safety/security of the package, at the time of incident/accident, should notify the licensee/owner and the RPO about the incident/accident; The licensee/owner and/or the RPO should ensure that the package is carefully examined to verify that it continues to comply with transport requirements. Radiation survey should be carried out to ensure that the radiation levels at a distance of five (5) cm, at the surface and at one (1) meter from the surface of the package are within acceptable range (i.e. category of package). In case if levels are exceeded, then the established emergency procedures should be followed [2]; If package is lost or theft during transport, the person(s) responsible for its safety/security should notify the licensee/owner and the RPO, and provide all relevant information that could facilitate an early recovery of the package.\\n\\n12 ACCOUNTABILITY OF RADIOGRAPHY SOURCES\\n\\n[1]\\n\\nLicensee should make necessary arrangements for the safety and security of the radiography sources (i.e. SRS and X-ray generators) so as to prevent the loss, theft, damage\\n\\n21\\n\\nand any unauthorized transfer or access to the sources. An accountability system, for such sources, should be established and maintained.\\n\\nFormal record containing the following information about the sources, wherever\\n\\napplicable, should be retained:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nName, identification/serial number, physical form and activity of sources with reference date (for SRS only);\\n\\nii. Maximum tube potential difference (kV) and current (mA), or maximum X-ray\\n\\nenergy (keV) and maximum output (dose rate);\\n\\niii. Manufacturer, model and identification number of exposure device(s)/package(s)\\n\\nand/or X-ray generator(s);\\n\\niv. Total number of sources in the custody including in use/disused SRS; v.\\n\\nLog for issuance and receipt of sources along with name of responsible person with dates;\\n\\nvi. Location of radiography work/site for which the source was issued; vii. Detail of disposed sources including date and method of disposal.\\n\\nThrough such accountability, the licensee should ensure that the locations of radiography sources are known at all times and losses are quickly identified and recovered. The record should always be kept updated and should be made available for verification during regulatory inspections. An updated inventory sheet of the sources should be submitted to the Authority biannually or earlier, if so desired by the Authority.\\n\\n13 LEAK TESTING\\n\\nThe purpose of leak testing is to ensure that the sealed radioactive sources remain intact and that there is no leakage or dispersal of radioactive material from the housing/casing of the source. Radiography sources (i.e. SRS only) should be “leak tested” at regular intervals as specified by the Authority. It should be noted that the frequency of the leak test ranges from biannually to once in several years. For instance, typical Cobalt-60 sources of activity greater than 370 GBq (10 Ci) are leak tested at every six (6) or twelve (12) months interval. Whereas, Iridium-192 sources are not normally leak tested because of their short half lives, they are typically disused within a year.\\n\\n14 EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\\n\\n[4]\\n\\nEver increasing application of ionizing radiation in industrial radiography requires having emergency preparedness and response arrangements in place to cater for the potential radiation emergencies associated with it. In industrial radiography, accidents/incidents may result in undue exposure of workers and members of the public. PNRA regulations PAK/914 requires the licensee to develop radiation emergency plan to be implemented during the course of an emergency. The purpose of such emergency planning is to control/restrict undue exposures As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP).\\n\\nThe concept of emergency preparedness and response is based on following major\\n\\n22\\n\\ncomponents:\\n\\ni. ii. iii. Acquisition of emergency equipment iv. v. vi.\\n\\nAssessment of hazards Preparation of emergency plan and procedure(s)\\n\\nConduct of training drills/exercises Periodic review of emergency plan and equipment Incident reporting\\n\\n14.1 Assessment of Hazards\\n\\nEmergency planning starts with an assessment of hazard which involves analysis of normal operating conditions, foreseeable abnormal conditions (such as equipment malfunction/failure, fire, flood, earthquake etc.), all possible types of accidents/incidents and their anticipated consequences. Experience feedback and analysis of past accidents/incidents in industrial radiography shows that most likely events involving radiography devices include, but not limited to, the following:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nFailure of radiographer to retract the radiography source and/or to perform pre/post job area survey Stuck of source in the guide tube, collimator or near the entrance of the exposure container\\n\\niii. Malfunctioning or defect in the safety control system iv. v. vi. vii. Handling/recovery of lost/stolen radiography source viii. Damage of radiography source container ix. Accident during transport of radiography source\\n\\nEntry of personnel into the controlled area during the exposure Un-intentionally energizing the X-ray machine Spread of contamination due to leaked or damaged radiography source(s)\\n\\nAll of the events enlisted above usually involve higher dose(s), in access of the prescribed dose limits, that may cause localized exposure resulting in severe radiation injury(ies).\\n\\n14.2 Preparation of Radiation Emergency Plan and Procedure(s)\\n\\nLicensee is responsible to prepare its radiation emergency plan and necessary implementing procedure(s) to cater for all the foreseeable types of incidents/emergencies. It should be concise and include a description of situations requiring emergency response actions. In particular, it should specify immediate actions to be taken, to minimize radiation exposure to individuals, in the vicinity of the source/incident.The implementing procedure(s) should describe the name(s) of the response officials, their contact details and means of communication during on and off working hours. The list of individuals/organizations having a role in implementation of the emergency response plan may include the following:\\n\\nŸ\\n\\nRadiation Protection Officer (RPO)\\n\\n23\\n\\nŸ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ\\n\\nQualified Expert PNRA (NRECC/Relevant RNSD) Medical Doctor Local Administration Emergency Services (Rescue 1122, Fire Fighting, Local Police, etc.) Security Incharge of the Facility\\n\\nThe licensee should provide the copy of its approved radiation emergency plan and its\\n\\nimplementing procedures to all relevant stakeholders.\\n\\n14.3 Acquisition of Emergency Equipment\\n\\nThe licensee of an industrial radiography facility should acquire/posses sufficient equipment to adequately respond to any anticipated emergency situation. This list of necessary emergency equipment may vary, however, it is likely to include the items as given in the table below:\\n\\nTable: List of Emergency Equipment\\n\\nSr. No.\\n\\nType\\n\\nItems\\n\\n1.\\n\\nRadiation Monitoring Instruments\\n\\nŸ High-Range Survey Meter (RID) Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD) Ÿ Ÿ Radionuclide Identification Device (RID)\\n\\n2.\\n\\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\\n\\nŸ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ Ÿ\\n\\nProtective Clothing Lead Shots/ Bricks Long Tongs Lead Goggles/ Gloves Shielded Container\\n\\n3.\\n\\nCommunication Equipment\\n\\nŸ Walkie-Talkie Ÿ Mobile Phones\\n\\n4.\\n\\nSupplies\\n\\nŸ Radiation Warning Signs Ÿ Barricading Tape Ÿ Mega Phone\\n\\nIn addition to the written and approved emergency plan; any supporting documents e.g.\\n\\nequipment operation manuals, etc. may also be included with the emergency equipment.\\n\\n14.4 Conduct of Training Drills/Exercises\\n\\nIn order to develop the capabilities required to implement radiation emergency plan, the licensee should train its staff to deal with the identified emergency situation(s). This training may include handling of emergency equipment and implementation of radiation emergency plan and its implementing procedure(s). Once this response capability is developed, specific drills and full scope emergency exercises should be conducted periodically (preferably once in a year). Such exercises not only help in providing training to emergency response workers but also test and validate the approved radiation emergency plan of the facility. The schedule of these emergency drills/exercises should be communicated to the Authority, well in advance, so that the Authority may witness the conduct of such drills/exercises.\\n\\n24\\n\\n14.5 Periodic Review of Emergency Plan and Equipment\\n\\nThe licensee should conduct formal review of emergency plan and implementing\\n\\nprocedure(s) annually to ensure that:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nAll responsible persons within the facility and relevant off-site organizations whose role is anticipated during response to a radiological emergency have been identified and their relevant contact details (i.e. telephone numbers and fax numbers) are up to date; Emergency equipment (as enlisted in Section 14.3) is readily available and is maintained in operable condition.\\n\\nSuch periodic reviews should take into account the lessons learnt from drills/exercises or in response to actual incidents/emergencies and should form the basis for revision/updation of emergency response plan and/or its implementing procedures.\\n\\n14.6 Incident Reporting\\n\\nThe licensee should notify any incident involving radiation source and warranting emergency response actions to the Authority through incident reporting performa. Such notifications should be followed up by a detailed written incident report that should include the following:\\n\\ni. ii. Actions taken to mitigate the situation, to regain the control and to restore the\\n\\nDescription of incident/emergency;\\n\\nconditions to normal; iii. Root cause of the accident; iv. v. vi. Lessons learnt/ experience feedback; vii. Recommendations/ corrective actions.\\n\\nTraining and experience of the personnel involved; Assessment of exposures (of the personnel involved);\\n\\nThe incident/emergency reports should be prepared by the RPO and approved by the\\n\\nmanagement, before submitting to the Authority.\\n\\n15 REFERENCES\\n\\n1. 2.\\n\\n3. 4.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nRegulations on Radiation Protection - PAK/904 Regulations on Management of a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency - PAK/914 (Rev.0) Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material - PAK/916 Radiation Safety in Industrial Radiography, Specific Safety Guide No. SSG-11, IAEA, 2011 Code of Practice for the Safe Use of Industrial Radiography Equipment, Radiation Health Series No. 31, National Health and Medical Research Council, Canberra, Australia, 1989\\n\\n25\\n\\nGLOSSARY\\n\\n(a) \"Absorbed Dose\" is a measure of energy that is deposited in a material per unit mass from any interaction with radiation.

This guide will be useful in implementation of regulatory requirements set under Section - 28(1) of PNRA regulations on radiation protection (PAK/904) and international safety standards set by ICRP through its Publication - 103. The effective implementation of these requirements would help to ensure protection of radiation workers, public, environment and patients from harmful effects of radiation.\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nRadio-iodine (I-131) is a gamma emitter which is used for diagnosis and treatment of thyroid carcinoma or hyperthyroidism. It is generally administered orally in liquid form in Pakistan. However, it is also available in capsule or caplet form in all over the world. Radiation dose to be administered to the patient for treatment of tumor is prescribed by a nuclear physician and it depends on many factors including tumor size, its location and staging etc.\\n\\nI-131 has been widely used in Nuclear Medicine Centers and its applications are largely beneficial for thyroid patients. The prime safety concern in the use of radioisotopes is that the patients, radiation workers and general public are not exposed to unnecessary radiation which is harmful to their health. While dealing with patients administered with I-131, all possible efforts should be made to minimize radiation exposure of the workers directly involved in administrating I-131 to the patients and to other workers and general public in and around the facility.\\n\\nThis guide is issued under the provisions of section-28(1) of PNRA “Regulations on Radiation Protection” - PAK/904 [1]. It mainly addresses various safety measures which are required to be taken during planning, designing and construction of radio-iodine facility. It also focuses on arrangements for handling and storage of radio-iodine, dose administration, actions to be taken in case of its spillage, decontamination procedure, storage of generated waste, visitors access control and radiation protection program of a facility.\\n\\n2\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\n\\nThe objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance for protection of patients, radiation workers, general public, and the environment from undue exposure and harmful effects of I-131.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nThis regulatory guide contains guidance on radiation safety, handling, usage and storage of I-131 and is mainly applicable to the nuclear medicine centers involved in diagnostic and therapeutic use of radio-iodine. The guide may also be used by the personnel involved in production of radio-iodine for medical and other industrial applications.\\n\\n4\\n\\nPRE-REQUISITES FOR PLANNING OF RADIO-IODINE FACILITY\\n\\nProper planning of the facility ensures more efficient radiation protection and easier supervision. The design of the facility should always allow for modifications and extension to meet future needs. Radio-Iodine facilities serve as clinical department of the hospital and preferably should be located such that the access of unauthorized personnel is controlled. Common use of other facilities of Nuclear Medicine Department (such as dispensing room, measurement room, storage room, radioactive waste disposal/storage room, and radiation\\n\\n2\\n\\nprotection arrangements etc.) reasonably reduces the costs of construction and number of personnel required.\\n\\nAt planning stage, the radio-iodine facility should generally be categorized into\\n\\nfollowing four groups:\\n\\ni. Laboratories and premises not frequented by patients, including rooms for the\\n\\nstorage, preparation, and dispensing of radio-iodine (controlled area).\\n\\nii. Premises frequented by patients, including rooms for administration of radio-iodine\\n\\nand for carrying out measurements on patients (controlled area). iii. Storage places for radioactive waste materials (controlled area). iv. Offices for doctors and other facility personnel (supervised area).\\n\\n4.1 Design Consideration for Facility\\n\\nGamma emitters are commonly used in Nuclear Medicine Departments; therefore, the background radiation is generally elevated. Radiation workers are exposed not only to the radiation received in nursing or dispensing the patients with radiopharmaceuticals in the laboratory but also to the continuous background radiation. Following recommendations should be considered in planning the radio-iodine facility to minimize the occupational exposure:\\n\\ni. Unnecessary radiation exposures should be avoided. ii. Radiation dose received by the radiation worker should not exceed his annual dose\\n\\nlimit of 20 mSv/year, as prescribed in PAK/904.\\n\\nAn effort should be made to ensure that the exposure received by a radiation worker remaining continually in a radiation room should be as low as reasonably possible. If the exposure of a radiation worker approaches to maximum annual limit of a radiation worker, then he may not be allowed to continue work in radiation environment for the remaining year. In addition, Section 27 of PNRA regulations on radiation protection (PAK/904) and Publication 103 of International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [2] recommend following conditions of work with respect to radiations:\\n\\na. Conditions such that the resulting (effective) dose might exceed 3/10th of the annual\\n\\ndose limit of radiation worker (Controlled Area).\\n\\nb. Conditions such that the resulting (effective) dose is most unlikely to exceed 3/10th\\n\\nof the annual dose limit of radiation worker (Supervised Area).\\n\\nAn important practical implication is that; under condition (a), the dose assessment of a radiation worker is usually based on individual monitoring for external radiations or internal contamination as appropriate; whereas under condition (b), workers may not require individual monitoring or special health supervision and it is sufficient in some cases to rely on area\\n\\n3\\n\\nmonitoring. If these factors are considered at planning stage, the initial design cost of the facility may increase, however, running cost of the facility which incur on account of dose monitoring, health surveillance , and provision of shielding equipments is reasonably reduced which in-turn compensate for initial design cost.\\n\\nIt is recommended that planning and construction should be carried out on the basis of assumption that there would be no area within the facility where the radiation workers can receive more than 10% of his average weekly dose limit i.e. the dose should not exceed 100 µSv/week. As a result, the average dose will not be greater than 2 µSv/h in a working week of about 50 hours (as is often the case in hospitals).\\n\\nThe radiation detection and measuring equipment used in the diagnostic measurement rooms is usually very sensitive and may require extra shielding. Therefore, the background radiation level in such locations should be as low as that in the normal rooms e.g. about 0.1 µGray/h.\\n\\n4.2 General Recommendations\\n\\nA standard Radio-Iodine Facility/Nuclear Medicine Center should have following features:\\n\\n2\\n\\ni. All rooms should be spacious i.e. having about 10m floor area [3]. ii. The radio-pharmacy should be tidy and separate benches should be used for\\n\\ndispensing.\\n\\niii. Separate areas/rooms should be designated for patients and staff. iv. Warning signs and instructions for visitors (particularly for pregnant women) should be prominently displayed in waiting area for the patients to whom radio-iodine is to be administered.\\n\\nv. Radiation warning signs and instructions should also be displayed in storage areas\\n\\nand dispensing rooms.\\n\\nvi. Isolation rooms should be available for admission of patients to whom therapeutic\\n\\ndose of radio-iodine is administered.\\n\\nvii. Radioactive waste collection bins should be available in hot lab, dispensing room and\\n\\npatient\\'s isolation rooms.\\n\\nviii.Appropriate shielding devices should be provided for nursing staff and comforters\\n\\nentering the isolation rooms.\\n\\nix. Bench tops, floors and patient toilets should be easy to wash and decontaminate. x. All relevant records should be prepared and maintained in an auditable form.\\n\\n4.3 Design of Radioisotope Laboratory (Hot Lab)\\n\\nRadioisotope Laboratory or Hot Lab is the most important place within the facility. Since\\n\\n4\\n\\nlarge activity of Iodine-131 is handled here, therefore, a trained technician should be available to handle radiopharmaceuticals under the supervision of a qualified Medical Physicist/ Radiation Protection Officer (RPO). Following important points should be taken into consideration while designing a radioisotope laboratory or hot lab:\\n\\ni. ii.\\n\\nThe radioisotope laboratory should be separate from other laboratories/places. Special attention should be given during the planning for ventilation, drains, fume hood, laminar airflow cabinet, disposal of waste and shielding requirement such that; Ÿ The ventilation of fume hoods should never be connected with the ventilation system of the building and the exhaust air should be released through charcoal filter and a straight corrosion-resistant tube at about 2 m above the roof.\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv. v. vi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nThe radioisotopes should be placed in shielded containers so that the background radiation level can be maintained as low as that in normal rooms (about 0.1µSv/h) [3]. Building expansion joints should not pass through the laboratory. The seating arrangement should allow ready escape in case of an emergency. Surface finishes to the walls, ceilings and furniture in the laboratory should be chosen so that they can be easily cleaned. Floors should be made non-slip. Floor covering should be impermeable with welded joints and be coved against the walls for ease of decontamination. Rubber, Vinyl, or Asphalt tiles used in the floor have the advantage that these can readily be removed by replacing a few tiles, if contaminated.\\n\\nviii. Cupboards used to store radioisotopes should be lockable; provided with metal\\n\\ntrays to contain spill and protect against fire.\\n\\nix. All hazards involved in the work should be considered such as radioactive\\n\\nx.\\n\\ncontamination, fire, mechanical, electrical, chemical and biological hazards etc. The entrance to hot lab should display a radiation warning sign and a text indicating \"entrance is restricted to authorized persons only\".\\n\\nxi. Hot Lab should be of sufficient size and separate work surfaces for handling\\n\\nxii.\\n\\nradioisotopes and office work should be provided. If dispensing room is part of the laboratory, this area should be segregated from the rest of the area, with no thorough passage. It should not be adjacent to film storage area or areas where low-level measurements are performed.\\n\\nxiii. Wor should be performed over absorbent surfaces; bench paper or spill trays\\n\\nshould be plastic-backed to prevent spread of contamination.\\n\\nxiv. Wash basins, provided with automated or elbow operated water taps, should be\\n\\nxv.\\n\\ninstalled. Sources of gamma or high-energy beta radiation should be handled using screen of lead glass or lead Perspex to protect the radiation worker.\\n\\n5\\n\\nxvi. The vials containing radiopharmaceuticals should be placed in a fume hood to avoid airborne contamination and be stored away from high-occupancy areas of the laboratory.\\n\\nxvii. Cupboards or enclosed storage areas that are used for holding\\n\\nradiopharmaceuticals should be well shielded.\\n\\nxviii. If significant quantities of liquid waste are to be disposed off into the sewerage system, disposal should preferably be attached with delay tanks. Otherwise, dilution and dispersion method should be opted.\\n\\nxix. Pedal-operated shielded buckets, reserved for radioactive waste only, labeled with\\n\\nradiation symbol should be provided in the hot lab [3].\\n\\nxx. After completing the work with radiopharmaceuticals, workers should wash their hands and monitor their hands and shoes for the presence of any contamination.\\n\\n4.4 Design of Dispensing Room\\n\\nFollowing recommendations should be taken into consideration while designing the dispensing room:\\n\\ni. The room should be of 8-10m2 area having a non-slip waterproof floor finish\\n\\nextending up to the walls to a height of about 10 cm [3].\\n\\nii. The floor covering should be impermeable with welded joints and be coved against the walls for ease of decontamination. Preference should be given to Rubber, Vinyl, or Asphalt tiles which have the advantage that these can readily be removed by replacing a few tiles, if contaminated.\\n\\niii. Wash basins for washing hands should be provided along with a hand monitor to\\n\\nensure that the staff has no contamination.\\n\\niv. Dispensing room should only be used for dispensing of radiopharmaceuticals for\\n\\ndiagnostic and therapeutic purposes.\\n\\nv. Pedal-operated shielded buckets, reserved for radioactive waste only, labeled with\\n\\nradiation symbol should be provided in the dispensing room.\\n\\n4.5 Design of Isolation Room\\n\\nFollowing points should be taken into account while designing the isolation rooms:\\n\\ni. An isolation room should have an attached toilet and shower facility. ii. The bed should be located as remotely as possible from the entrance door and portable shielding screens should be used by the staff while visiting the patient\\'s room.\\n\\niii. Floor, walls and furniture surfaces should be smooth, continuous and impermeable\\n\\nfor ease of decontamination.\\n\\niv. Warning signs and instructions should be displayed outside the room door for\\n\\n6\\n\\nawareness of the visitors/comforters.\\n\\n4.6 Storage and Disposal of Radioactive Waste\\n\\nRadioactive waste should be disposed off in a manner that all regulatory requirements as specified in PNRA regulations on radioactive waste management - PAK/915 [4] are met. Solid radioactive waste should be collected and stored in shielded bins available in the area where it is generated prior to disposal. Liquid radioactive waste should be collected in delay tanks and not to be discharged in ordinary sewerage for disposal (except for patient excreta) unless authorized by RPO after ensuring that there is no radiation risk to the environment. General guidelines for handling and disposal of radioactive waste are outlined below.\\n\\ni. ii. iii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv. vi.\\n\\nVolume of solid waste should be kept as small as possible. A separate room for interim storage of radioactive waste should be available. The room should be locked, ventilated and properly marked with instructions and radiation warning signs. Radioactive waste (vials, syringes, bags, etc) should be segregated and should be collected in separate containers properly labeled providing information about the radionuclide, its activity and concentration etc. Flammable material should not be kept inside the radioactive waste storage room. Lids of radioactive waste bins and containers should be securely placed at all times even when the containers are not in use.\\n\\nvii. Radioactive waste containing infectious material should be treated to render it non-\\n\\ninfectious prior to disposal.\\n\\nviii. Record should be maintained in a retrievable manner which includes the date of disposal, model and serial number of survey instrument used, the background radiation level, dose rate measured at the surface of each waste container, and the name of individual who performed the disposal.\\n\\nix. Generated radioactive waste should be stored for the purpose of delay and decay for a minimum period of 6 months prior to its final disposal (irrespective of its activity and half life) and relevant records should be retained for 3 years.\\n\\n4.7 Warning Signs and Labels\\n\\nRadiation warning signs and instructions should be displayed prominently outside the radiation area. These instructions should indicate possible radiation risk and dose level that may be present in the area. Magenta or black on a yellow background trefoil warning sign should be used to indicate the presence of ionizing radiations.\\n\\n5\\n\\nPROCEDURE FOR HANDLING RADIO-IODINE\\n\\nThe following procedures should be adopted in all cases where radioiodine is being\\n\\nhandled.\\n\\n7\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nThe radioiodine should always be stored in a shielded container placed in a controlled area. The lead container should be of 1-3 cm thickness to ensure minimum dose rate at external surface of the container [3].\\n\\niii. Vials containing radio-iodine should always be handled in the fume hood. iv.\\n\\nReceptacles, fabrics, clothing, handkerchiefs etc., likely to become contaminated should be of disposable nature, whenever practicable. All items known or suspected to be contaminated should be stored in containers, which can be readily decontaminated or disposed off. Such items should be disposed off under the supervision of RPO to ensure the level of contamination is below the exemption level.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi. All items of non-disposable nature should be checked under the supervision of RPO to determine the level of contamination before and after decontamination, and returned to routine use when declared to be clear by the RPO.\\n\\nvii. Nursing staff carrying out procedures which may result in contamination of skin and/or clothing should wear protective gloves and gowns. Their hands and clothing should be monitored after completion of work and if necessary, decontamination should be performed under the supervision of RPO, without any delay.\\n\\nviii. Catheterization should be considered when the patient is, or likely to be, incontinent or otherwise incapacitated, to avoid spread of contamination over his clothes, bedding or floor.\\n\\nix. Nappies of infant inpatients administered with radio-iodine should be changed frequently and the used ones, properly sealed in thick plastic bags, should be disposed off/ stored for decay. The ideal method for hospitalized patients, administered with greater than 30mCi radio-iodine, is the use of special toilet suite connected to delay-and-decay tanks. However, the patient, who is administered with less than 30mCi should use an ordinary toilet which has been reserved solely for that patient\\'s use during treatment.\\n\\nx.\\n\\nSpecial precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of spill of radioactive body fluids e.g. vomit, blood, urine and feces etc. Instructions should be given by RPO to take appropriate action in the event of a spill of radioactive body fluid. These instructions should be prepared based on following detail regarding minor and major spill of radioactive fluids:\\n\\n5.1 Minor Spills\\n\\nMinor spills include typically less than 100 times exempted quantities of radionuclides mentioned in ANNEX-I of PNRA regulations on radiation protection (PAK/904). In case of a\\n\\n8\\n\\nminor spill, following procedural steps should be followed:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nInform persons in the affected area that a spill has occurred. Keep them away from the contaminated place. Clean up the spill by wearing protective clothing and disposable gloves, using absorbent paper and place it in a plastic bag for transfer to a labeled waste container.\\n\\niii. Work from outside of the spill towards the centre to avoid spreading of\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv. vi.\\n\\ncontamination. Carry out wipe test or survey for residual contamination as appropriate. Repeat decontamination, if necessary, until surface contamination monitoring results reach the dose rate less than 0.02mR/h (0.2 µSv/h) [8]. Check hands, clothing, and shoes for presence of contamination, if any. Report the spill and decontamination results to the person incharge and, if necessary, to the RPO.\\n\\nvii. Record necessary details regarding spill and decontamination results. Update the\\n\\nradionuclide\\'s inventory and waste records accordingly.\\n\\n5.2 Major Spills\\n\\nMajor spills involve more than 100 times of exempted quantities of radionuclides or contamination of personnel or release of volatile radioactive material. In case of major spills, following procedural steps should be followed:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii. iii.\\n\\nImmediately evacuate and cordon off the spill area and post warning sign(s) to prevent further entry of personnel. Notify the RPO or person in-charge immediately. The RPO should take decision for carrying out decontamination of affected area, personnel and necessary cleanup operations.\\n\\niv. Decontaminate personnel by removing their contaminated clothing and flushing\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\ncontaminated part of skin with lukewarm water and mild soap. Follow the decontamination procedures as prescribed earlier for minor spills and repeat if necessary until contamination monitoring results approaches the dose rate value of less than 0.02mR/h (0.2 µSv/h) [8]. If the spill occurs in a laboratory, leave the fume hood running to minimize the release of volatile radionuclides to adjacent rooms and hallways.\\n\\nvii. Record the names of persons involved in handling the spill and conducting\\n\\nnecessary recovery operations.\\n\\nviii. All the persons involved should be monitored for contamination before leaving the\\n\\nix.\\n\\nspillage area. The RPO should arrange for any bioassay measurements, if necessary.\\n\\n9\\n\\nx.\\n\\nThe RPO should submit a detailed report to PNRA within two months of the incident.\\n\\n6\\n\\nDOSE ADMINISTRATION\\n\\nThere are different methodologies for dose administration that are adopted worldwide. Usually therapeutic dose of I-131 is administered in a single dose/fraction having activity about 5550MBq or in multiple doses/fractions of activity 1110MBq per fraction. The patient, to whom more than 1110MBq of I-131 is administered, should be hospitalized and should not be discharged until the activity is less than 1110MBq and the measured dose rate at one meter from the patient is less than 20-50µSv/h (as a good practice). Moreover, if patient-specific calculations demonstrate that potential total effective dose to any individual around him would not be greater than 5mSv then he may be discharged from the hospital with specific set of instructions .\\n\\nOn a specified time, the vial containing radio-iodine which is to be administered is brought on a cart to the patient\\'s room in its shielded shipping container according to the transport requirements as specified in PNRA regulations for the safe transport of radioactive material - PAK/916 [6]. Before dose administration, the nursing staff must ensure that all aspects of therapy have been explained to the patient and that the patient has signed the therapy consent form. Once this has been confirmed, the dose can be administered. All contamination precautions must now be observed. The nursing staff or any other individual entering the isolation room should wear necessary protective clothing which include; 2 pairs of shoe covers, 2 pairs of disposable gloves, surgical gown, a mask and optional hair cover.\\n\\nGreater care must be exercised while administering the radio-iodine dose. Plastic-lined absorbent pads should be used to cover the dosing table and those areas of patient\\'s body that may be subjected to any potential spillage. The vial must remain in its shielded container during administration and a straw should be provided to the patient to drink the radionuclide contents. Once the dose is administered, the nursing staff should wrap the shielded dose vial, straw, and any other possibly contaminated items in the absorbent pads and remove them from the room. The dose vial should be assayed promptly to determine the residual activity so that the actual administered activity could be calculated. This determination of administered activity can be used in conjunction with daily exposure rate measurements to determine the activity remaining in the patient\\'s body. An expression to determine the activity remaining in the patient\\'s body based on exposure rates is given below:\\n\\nActivity Administered = (Total Activity Residual Activity) MBq\\n\\n\\n\\nRemaining Activity =\\n\\nNew Exposure Rate\\n\\nInitial Exposure Rate\\n\\nx\\n\\nAdministered Activity\\n\\n10\\n\\n6.1 Precautionary Measures after Dose Administration\\n\\nFollowing precautionary measures should be followed after the administration of radio-\\n\\niodine dose to the patient [7]:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nNursing staff should be trained and strict compliance of radiation protection requirements must be ensured by the licensee. Once the patient is admitted in the isolation room after administration of radio- iodine dose, nurse in-charge should inform him about any expected cause of contamination and duration of its persistence.\\n\\niii. Door of the isolation room should be kept closed when the patient is admitted. iv.\\n\\nContainers should be provided for temporary storage of used utensils and linen, before they are checked for contamination. The patient should be instructed to attend the collection of excreta preferably himself and hand it over to the nursing staff.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi. When prolonged nursing care is necessary, it should be so divided among the ward staff that the dose received by each individual during his shift is kept to a minimum.\\n\\n7\\n\\nDECONTAMINATION\\n\\nContamination occurs when a radionuclide spreads beyond its normal place of confinement. The radionuclide thus spread may contaminate the environment (air, water, floors, and surfaces in general) and become partly fixed. It may eventually affect human beings internally or externally by exposing them to the radiations being emitted. The external contamination may involve; personnel, clothing and bedding, laboratory equipment and instruments, working surfaces and other surfaces in the room. Every nuclear medicine centre handling radio-iodine should establish decontamination team composed of personnel specially trained in decontamination techniques and possessing all necessary equipment and chemicals required for decontamination.\\n\\n7.1 Decontamination of Personnel\\n\\nRadio-iodine can affect persons who handle it or those who come in contact with the patients carrying radio-iodine (through vomiting, discharges associated with injections, contaminated bed linen, and excreta). It takes the form of contamination on the hands or other areas of the skin or scalp.\\n\\nRadiation exposure to the skin considerably increases when the skin is externally contaminated. Moreover, internal contamination increases if radio-iodine passes through open wounds. If contamination monitor detects contamination of hands or skin, the radioactivity can be reduced below the detection level by carefully washing the skin with soap. Ordinary soap has proved to be the best decontaminant in the event of skin contamination. If the contamination persists, decontamination should be repeated by a decontamination team. One\\n\\n11\\n\\ncan try to reduce the radioactivity by washing the skin with an entraining agent (A detergent ointment with a titanium dioxide base/or saturated potassium permanganate solution). Chemical treatments of this kind should be applied with care in order not to damage the skin, and the same is true for the use of light abrasives and scrubbing agents. Every nuclear medicine center should be equipped with eye-cups and shower facility in the vicinity of change room.\\n\\n7.2 Decontamination of Clothing and Bedding\\n\\nIn nuclear medicine centers/hospitals, clothing and bedding usually become contaminated by perspiration, discharges following injections, incontinence of a patient, vomiting, or due to some other reasons. It is important to change the contaminated clothing and bedding immediately and to seal and store them in polythene bags until they can be sent to laundry.\\n\\nContaminated clothing carries the risk of irradiation of skin and the hazard of internal exposure, if radio-iodine is inhaled or ingested. It can easily be detected with portable contamination monitors. Contaminated clothes and bedding or linen should be washed in a special laundry so as to avoid the washing of contaminated and non contaminated clothing together. Either soap or a detergent can be used for washing.\\n\\nThe operation is preceded and followed by extensive rinsing. A hot 1% Citric Acid solution can also be used. Highly contaminated clothing or linen can be stored for a while to allow the short-lived radionuclides to decay. If contamination with long-lived radioisotopes cannot be removed by laundering, the linen should be treated as radioactive waste. After laundering, clothing should be monitored for residual contamination. Residual levels should be within the limits specified in ANNEX-I of PAK/904.\\n\\n7.3 Decontamination of Equipment and Apparatus\\n\\nThe contamination of equipment such as glassware and minor laboratory tools is highly undesirable as it may lead to contamination of the staff and may also be a source of errors in analyses and measurements. The degree of contamination of laboratory equipment and apparatus is often difficult to determine with accuracy. All parts of equipment/instrument should be assumed as contaminated, prior to conducting decontamination activity.\\n\\nAfter use, porcelain and glassware should be cleaned with appropriate detergents or chemical decontaminants. Chromic Acid cleaning mixture (K Cr 0 + H S0 ) is most commonly used chemical decontaminant. Other chemical agents such as Ammonium Citrate [(NH ) C H O ], Penta-sodium Tri-phosphate (Na P O ) and Ammonium Fluoride (NH HF ) can also be used. Metal objects should first be cleaned with good detergents; if contamination persists then complexing agents (Acitrate-Edetic Acid mixture), Ammonium Fluoride, or dilute acid solutions may be used. Ordinary metal cleaners are usually used to clean stainless steel equipment/instrument. If contamination still persists, a mild abrasive such as a mixture of\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n7\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n4 3\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n7\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n12\\n\\nNitric Acid and 1% Sodium Fluoride can be employed.\\n\\nIf above methods prove inadequate, one can resort to sand-blasting and/or ultrasonic techniques. The choice of method depends primarily on the type of equipment and whether or not it can withstand the treatment which might lead to the loss of material. If the contaminant is a short-lived radionuclide, the equipment/instrument which proves difficult to decontaminate must be stored until the radioactivity has decayed; otherwise it must be disposed off as a radioactive waste.\\n\\n7.4 Decontamination of Surfaces and Floors\\n\\nContamination of working surfaces, floors, and corridors may originate from spills, settling of aerosols present in the air and the transfer of contamination through shoes. It may also result from an incident involving contamination such as overturning of radioactive solutions or substances and vomiting etc. The result of such incident may be the contamination of surfaces, floors, skin, clothing and bedding. The contaminating material may also form a suspension in the air and lead to internal exposure if inhaled.\\n\\nWorking surfaces and floors should be periodically checked for contamination and should be decontaminated whenever the levels exceed allowable limits. The cleaning-up operation should usually be carried out by sweeping the surface with a broom or brush wetted with a suitable agent, or by mopping it with a damp cloth. Dry sweeping should always be avoided as it may result into the contamination becoming airborne. Linoleum-covered or painted floors should be decontaminated by means of detergents, care being taken to avoid the spreading of contamination. If contamination persists, the floor coverings or paint must be removed.\\n\\nWhen a radioactive solution is spilt, the first step is to prevent the contamination from spreading. The liquid should be covered with sawdust, absorbent material or dry rags immediately. Decontamination can be carried out by mopping the surface with a damp cloth, by ordinary washing, or by scrubbing. If a patient vomits within five hours of administrating radio-iodine dose, all affected floors, bedding, linen, and persons around him must undergo same decontamination procedures as are applied in the event of spillage of radio-iodine.\\n\\n7.5 Wipe Test\\n\\nWipe tests are used to determine the amount and level of contamination present in the affected area, however, it does not measure the entire contamination that is present. The procedure followed for wipe test consists of the following steps:\\n\\ni. ii. Wipe the filter paper or a cotton swab of appropriate size across the affected area.\\n\\nPut on disposable gloves.\\n\\nDry wipes should preferably be used.\\n\\n13\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nFor determination of contamination on the surface of a package, an area of 300 cm2 should be wiped. For determination of contamination on a working surface or a floor, an area of 100 cm2 should be wiped. Take the activity counts of a background sample and the test sample using a well shape counter with Sodium Iodide (NaI) detector. Compare this reading with the applicable threshold levels; carryout the decontamination procedure, if it exceeds the applicable threshold level.\\n\\n8\\n\\nCONTROL OF VISITORS\\n\\nThe management of the facility is responsible to protect the visitors from undue exposure to radiations. Following precautionary measures should be adopted for the protection of personnel visiting the patients:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii. iv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nVisitors should not be allowed to visit their patients within 48 hours after administration of radio-iodine. Un-necessary visits/meetings should be discouraged. Pregnant women and children under the age of 18 should not be permitted to visit the patient admitted in isolation room. The duration of visit should be as short as possible. Visitors should be advised to keep themselves at a reasonable distance from the patient (preferably at a distance of about 2m or behind the shielded screens). Visitors should be advised not to kiss the patient and not even eat, drink or smoke in the patient\\'s room.\\n\\nvi. Visitors should also be advised to avoid using the toilet or sink in the patient\\'s\\n\\nroom.\\n\\n9\\n\\nRADIATION PROTECTION PROGRAM\\n\\nThe management of a facility/nuclear medicine center must ensure that a Radiation Protection Program is developed, documented, implemented and regularly reviewed to ensure safety in all practices in which radioisotopes are used. The radiation protection program of the facility should include the following:\\n\\ni. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii.\\n\\nWork practices; Roles and responsibilities of RPO, Nursing Staff etc; Radiation monitoring requirements and availability of monitoring equipment ; Control of incidents involving contamination; Storage and transportation arrangements of radiopharmaceuticals; Radiation protection measures applicable in isolation rooms; Inventory control and records of radiopharmaceuticals; and\\n\\n14\\n\\nviii. Any other requirement that may have bearing on safety.\\n\\n10 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES\\n\\nEach facility/nuclear medicine center is responsible to ensure that emergency plan for the incidents and emergencies involving radionuclides is developed and effectively implemented. Emergency procedures for the implementation of emergency plan should be identified while developing the emergency plan of the facility. Following items should be considered during preparation of emergency procedures:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nii.\\n\\niii.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nv.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nInstructions on immediate actions that need to be taken to protect human life, limit injury and provide first aid where required; Instructions on immediate actions needed to bring the incident under control, including details on actions necessary to prevent further spread of contamination (if this possibility arises); Instructions for personnel involved to report the incident to RPO or his designated alternate; Instructions for the RPO or his designated alternate to communicate this information and any follow-up on the developing situation to PNRA; Lists containing names, addresses and telephone numbers of responsible personnel required in the event of an emergency (these should be checked and updated at least once every six months and/or whenever changes in the arrangements are made); Instructions to be followed when safety procedures or working rules are not sufficient; and Instructions on emergency response actions following radioactive spillage, vomiting, fire, flood, explosion or any other disaster or incident within the facility.\\n\\n15\\n\\n11 REFERENCES\\n\\n[1] [2]\\n\\n[3]\\n\\n[4] [5]\\n\\nPNRA “Regulations on Radiation Protection” - PAK/904.

DOSE: A measure of the energy deposited by radiation in a target. It includes absorbed dose, committed equivalent dose, committed effective dose, effective dose, equivalent dose or organ dose. DOSE RATE: The radiation dose delivered per unit time and measured in dose per second or dose per hour e.g. milisieverts per hour. DOSIMETER: A device that measures radiation dose, such as film badge, ionization chamber, or TLD. EXPOSURE RATE: The amount of ionization produced in air per time, in units of R/hr for example. NORMAL/RADIATION ROOMS: A room in which radiation level is about 10µrad/h is known as normal room and if in any room radiation level is higher than 10µrad/h is categorized as radiation room. OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE: Exposure of an individual to radiation (1) in a restricted area; or (2) in the course of employment in which the individual\\'s duties involve exposure to radiation. PNRA: Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority. RADIATION: Ionizing radiation i.e. gamma rays, X-rays, alpha and beta particles, high speed electrons, neutrons, and other nuclear particles. RADIATION AREA: Any area accessible to individuals in whom there exists radiation at such levels that a person could receive a dose equivalent in excess of 50µSv in one hour at 30 centimeters from the source or any surface that the radiation penetrates. RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL: Any material (solid, liquid, or gas) which emits radiation spontaneously. RADIOACTIVITY: The disintegration of unstable atomic nuclei by the emission of radiation. RESTRICTED AREA: Any area where access is controlled by the licensee for the purpose of protection of individuals from exposure to radiation and radioactive material. RPO: Radiation Protection Officer. SUPERVISED AREA: A defined area not designated as controlled area but for which occupational exposure conditions are kept under review, even though no specific protection measures or safety provisions are normally needed. TLD: Thermo luminescent dosimeter.\\n\\n17\\n\\nPAKISTAN NUCLEAR REGULATORY AUTHORITY P.O. Box 1912, Islamabad www.pnra.org'),\n",

The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) is the primary governmental body in Pakistan responsible for the peaceful use and development of nuclear energy and related technologies. Established in 1956, PAEC plays a pivotal role in various fields, including power generation, health, agriculture, research, and industry, while ensuring compliance with international safety and regulatory standards.PAEC has established a network of 19+ cancer treatment centers across the country, providingDiagnosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases.Nuclear medicine facilities.Radiation therapy services.Aemck is a pioneer cancer hospital of paec, established in 1960 at Jinnah post graduate medical center) jpmc . Atomic Energy Medical Center Karachi is the pioneer Medical Centre of PAEC, established in 1960 at the premises of JPMC, Karachi for provision of nuclear diagnostic and treatment facilities. It started in a two rooms barrack that were present at this place and with only a rectilinear scanner and a thyroid uptake probe. The facilities have been continually upgraded/ updated from time to time to keep pace with new requirements.
In its previous status up to 2010, AEMC Karachi was providing diagnostic & partial treatment facilities to 3000 patients per month and the available equipment/building was quite insufficient to meet the ever increasing diagnostic and treatment requirements of the growing number of patients. Keeping in view these requirements, up gradation of the center and shifting to a new, larger building and replacement of old conventional equipment with new modern sophisticated equipment was planned in early 2000. Moreover, modern radiotherapy facilities that were critically needed to cater to the growing number of cancer patients. Up gradation of AEMC completed in due time and new modalities of cancer treatment as well as diagnosis were included namely Radiotherapy and its allied services, Brachytherapy and expansion of Clinical Lab Services.
Thus at present AEMC Karachi has converted into a full-fledge tertiary care medical facility, providing services in sophisticated diagnosis at Nuclear Medicine  and Radiology departments as well as therapy by the use of Radiations at Radiotherapy and Brachytherapy departments.  In order to make these facilities available, AEMC uses various radioactive sources both natural and artificial. These include isotopes of Technetium, Iodine, Cobalt, Iridium, Barium, Caesium, Europium and Strontium. Other radiation generators comprise of Linear accelerators of Mega Voltage energy range, X-rays from diagnostic X-ray, CT Simulator, Mammography Unit and a conventional fluoroscopic radiotherapy Simulator. 
Atomic Energy Medical Centre (AEMC) is located within the Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre (J.P.M.C) premises, at Rafiqui Shaheed Road, Karachi. It neighbors to Ward-7 of JPMC opposite to Basic Medical Sciences Institute .SOP for Receiving I-131 Consignment & Record KeepingI-131 CONSIGNMENT RECORD

GUIDANCE FOR THE USERS OF IODINE-131 IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
CENTERS
ABSTRACT
This regulatory guide is developed to provide guidance to the users of Iodine-131 (I-131)
which is mainly used in nuclear medicine centers for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
This guide will be useful in implementation of regulatory requirements set under Section
- 28(1) of PNRA regulations on radiation protection (PAK/904) and international safety
standards set by ICRP through its Publication - 103. The effective implementation of
these requirements would help to ensure protection of radiation workers, public,
environment and patients from harmful effects of radiation.
1
1 INTRODUCTION
Radio-iodine (I-131) is a gamma emitter which is used for diagnosis and treatment of
thyroid carcinoma or hyperthyroidism. It is generally administered orally in liquid form in
Pakistan. However, it is also available in capsule or caplet form in all over the world. Radiation
dose to be administered to the patient for treatment of tumor is prescribed by a nuclear
physician and it depends on many factors including tumor size, its location and staging etc.
I-131 has been widely used in Nuclear Medicine Centers and its applications are largely
beneficial for thyroid patients. The prime safety concern in the use of radioisotopes is that the
patients, radiation workers and general public are not exposed to unnecessary radiation which
is harmful to their health. While dealing with patients administered with I-131, all possible
efforts should be made to minimize radiation exposure of the workers directly involved in
administrating I-131 to the patients and to other workers and general public in and around the
facility.
This guide is issued under the provisions of section-28(1) of PNRA “Regulations on
Radiation Protection” - PAK/904 [1]. It mainly addresses various safety measures which are
required to be taken during planning, designing and construction of radio-iodine facility. It also
focuses on arrangements for handling and storage of radio-iodine, dose administration, actions
to be taken in case of its spillage, decontamination procedure,  storage of generated waste,
visitors access control and radiation protection program of a facility.
2 OBJECTIVE
The objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance for protection of patients,
radiation workers, general public, and the environment from undue exposure and harmful
effects of I-131.
3 SCOPE
This regulatory guide contains guidance on radiation safety, handling, usage and storage
of I-131 and is mainly applicable to the nuclear medicine centers involved in diagnostic and
therapeutic use of radio-iodine.  The guide may also be used by the personnel involved in
production of radio-iodine for medical and other industrial applications. 
4 PRE-REQUISITES FOR PLANNING OF RADIO-IODINE FACILITY
Proper planning of the facility ensures more efficient radiation protection and easier
supervision. The design of the facility should always allow for modifications and extension to
meet future needs. Radio-Iodine facilities serve as clinical department of the hospital and
preferably should be located such that the access of unauthorized personnel is controlled.
Common use of other facilities of Nuclear Medicine Department (such as dispensing room,
measurement room, storage room, radioactive waste disposal/storage room, and radiation 
2
protection arrangements etc.) reasonably reduces the costs of construction and number of
personnel required. 
At planning stage, the radio-iodine facility should generally be categorized into
following four groups:
i. Laboratories and premises not frequented by patients, including rooms for the
storage, preparation, and dispensing of radio-iodine (controlled area).
ii. Premises frequented by patients, including rooms for administration of radio-iodine
and for carrying out measurements on patients (controlled area).
iii. Storage places for radioactive waste materials (controlled area).
iv. Offices for doctors and other facility personnel (supervised area).
4.1 Design Consideration for Facility
Gamma emitters are commonly used in Nuclear Medicine Departments; therefore, the
background radiation is generally elevated. Radiation workers are exposed not only to the
radiation received in nursing or dispensing the patients with radiopharmaceuticals in the
laboratory but also to the continuous background radiation.  Following recommendations
should be considered in planning the radio-iodine facility to minimize the occupational
exposure: 
i. Unnecessary radiation exposures should be avoided.
ii. Radiation dose received by the radiation worker should not exceed his annual dose
limit of 20 mSv/year, as prescribed in PAK/904.
An effort should be made to ensure that the exposure received by a radiation worker
remaining continually in a radiation room should be as low as reasonably possible. If the
exposure of a radiation worker approaches to maximum annual limit of a radiation worker, then
he may not be allowed to continue work in radiation environment for the remaining year. In
addition, Section 27 of PNRA regulations on radiation protection (PAK/904) and Publication
103 of International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [2] recommend following
conditions of work with respect to radiations:
a. Conditions such that the resulting (effective) dose might exceed 3/10th of the annual
dose limit of radiation worker (Controlled Area).
b. Conditions such that the resulting (effective) dose is most unlikely to exceed 3/10th
of the annual dose limit of radiation worker (Supervised Area).
An important practical implication is that; under condition (a), the dose assessment of a
radiation worker is usually based on individual monitoring for external radiations or internal
contamination as appropriate; whereas under condition (b), workers may not require individual
monitoring or special health supervision and it is sufficient in some cases to rely on area 
3
monitoring. If these factors are considered at planning stage, the initial design cost of the
facility may increase, however, running cost of the facility which incur on account of  dose
monitoring, health surveillance , and  provision of shielding equipments is reasonably reduced
which in-turn compensate for initial design cost.
 
It is recommended that planning and construction should be carried out on the basis of 
assumption that there would be no area within the facility where the radiation workers can
receive more than 10% of his average weekly dose limit i.e. the dose should not exceed 100
Sv/week. As a result, the average dose will not be greater than 2 Sv/h in a working week of
about 50 hours (as is often the case in hospitals).
The radiation detection and measuring equipment used in the diagnostic measurement 
rooms is usually very sensitive and may require extra shielding. Therefore, the background
radiation level in such locations should be as low as that in the normal rooms e.g. about 0.1
Gray/h.
4.2 General Recommendations
A standard Radio-Iodine Facility/Nuclear Medicine Center should have following
features: 
2
i. All rooms should be spacious i.e. having about 10m  floor area [3].
ii. The radio-pharmacy should be tidy and separate benches should be used for
dispensing.
iii. Separate areas/rooms should be designated for patients and staff.
iv. Warning signs and instructions for visitors (particularly for pregnant women) should
be prominently displayed in waiting area for the patients to whom radio-iodine is to
be administered.
v. Radiation warning signs and instructions should also be displayed in storage areas
and dispensing rooms.
vi. Isolation rooms should be available for admission of patients to whom therapeutic
dose of radio-iodine is administered.
vii. Radioactive waste collection bins should be available in hot lab, dispensing room and
patient's isolation rooms.
viii.Appropriate shielding devices should be provided for nursing staff and comforters
entering the isolation rooms.
ix. Bench tops, floors and patient toilets should be easy to wash and decontaminate.
x. All relevant records should be prepared and maintained in an auditable form. 
4.3 Design of Radioisotope Laboratory (Hot Lab)
Radioisotope Laboratory or Hot Lab is the most important place within the facility. Since 
4
large activity of Iodine-131 is handled here, therefore, a trained technician should be available
to handle radiopharmaceuticals under the supervision of a qualified Medical Physicist/
Radiation Protection Officer (RPO). Following important points should be taken into
consideration while designing a radioisotope laboratory or hot lab: 
i.
The radioisotope laboratory should be separate from other laboratories/places. 
ii.
Special attention should be given during the planning for ventilation, drains, fume
hood, laminar airflow cabinet, disposal of waste and shielding requirement such
that;
Ÿ The ventilation of fume hoods should never be connected with the ventilation
system of the building and the exhaust air should be released through charcoal
filter and a straight corrosion-resistant tube at about 2 m above the roof.
iii. The radioisotopes should be placed in shielded containers so that the background
radiation level can be maintained as low as that in normal rooms (about 0.1µSv/h)
[3].
iv. Building expansion joints should not pass through the laboratory.
v. The seating arrangement should allow ready escape in case of an emergency.
vi. Surface finishes to the walls, ceilings and furniture in the laboratory should be
chosen so that they can be easily cleaned.
vii. Floors should be made non-slip. Floor covering should be impermeable with
welded joints and be coved against the walls for ease of decontamination. Rubber,
Vinyl, or Asphalt tiles used in the floor have the advantage that these can readily be
removed by replacing a few tiles, if contaminated.
viii. Cupboards used to store radioisotopes should be lockable; provided with metal
trays to contain spill and protect against fire.
ix. All hazards involved in the work should be considered such as radioactive
contamination, fire, mechanical, electrical, chemical and biological hazards etc.
x. The entrance to hot lab should display a radiation warning sign and a text indicating
"entrance is restricted to authorized persons only".
xi. Hot Lab should be of sufficient size and separate work surfaces for handling
radioisotopes and office work should be provided.
xii. If dispensing room is part of the laboratory, this area should be segregated from the
rest of the area, with no thorough passage. It should not be adjacent to film storage
area or areas where low-level measurements are performed.
xiii. Wor should be performed over absorbent surfaces; bench paper or spill trays
should be plastic-backed to prevent spread of contamination.
xiv. Wash basins, provided with automated or elbow operated water taps, should be
installed.
xv. Sources of gamma or high-energy beta radiation should be handled using screen of
lead glass or lead Perspex to protect the radiation worker. 
5
xvi. The vials containing radiopharmaceuticals should be placed in a fume hood to
avoid airborne contamination and be stored away from high-occupancy areas of
the laboratory. 
xvii. Cupboards or enclosed storage areas that are used for holding
radiopharmaceuticals should be well shielded. 
xviii. If significant quantities of liquid waste are to be disposed off into the sewerage
system, disposal should preferably be attached with delay tanks. Otherwise,
dilution and dispersion method should be opted.
xix. Pedal-operated shielded buckets, reserved for radioactive waste only, labeled with
radiation symbol should be provided in the hot lab [3].  
xx. After completing the work with radiopharmaceuticals, workers should wash their
hands and monitor their hands and shoes for the presence of any contamination.
4.4 Design of Dispensing Room
Following recommendations should be taken into consideration while designing the
dispensing room:
i. The room should be of 8-10m2 area having a non-slip waterproof floor finish
extending up to the walls to a height of about 10 cm [3]. 
ii. The floor covering should be impermeable with welded joints and be coved against
the walls for ease of decontamination. Preference should be given to Rubber, Vinyl,
or Asphalt tiles which have the advantage that these can readily be removed by
replacing a few tiles, if contaminated.
iii. Wash basins for washing hands should be provided along with a hand monitor to
ensure that the staff has no contamination. 
iv. Dispensing room should only be used for dispensing of radiopharmaceuticals for
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
v. Pedal-operated shielded buckets, reserved for radioactive waste only, labeled with
radiation symbol should be provided in the dispensing room.
4.5 Design of Isolation Room
Following points should be taken into account while designing the isolation rooms:

i. An isolation room should have an attached toilet and shower facility.
ii. The bed should be located as remotely as possible from the entrance door and
portable shielding screens should be used by the staff while visiting the patient's
room.
iii. Floor, walls and furniture surfaces should be smooth, continuous and impermeable
for ease of decontamination.
iv. Warning signs and instructions should be displayed outside the room door for 
6
awareness of the visitors/comforters.
4.6 Storage and Disposal of Radioactive Waste
Radioactive waste should be disposed off in a manner that all regulatory requirements as
specified in PNRA regulations on radioactive waste management - PAK/915 [4] are met. Solid
radioactive waste should be collected and stored in shielded bins available in the area where it
is generated prior to disposal. Liquid radioactive waste should be collected in delay tanks and
not to be discharged in ordinary sewerage for disposal (except for patient excreta) unless
authorized by RPO after ensuring that there is no radiation risk to the environment. General
guidelines for handling and disposal of radioactive waste are outlined below.
i. Volume of solid waste should be kept as small as possible.
ii. A separate room for interim storage of radioactive waste should be available.
iii. The room should be locked, ventilated and properly marked with instructions and
radiation warning signs.
iv. Radioactive waste (vials, syringes, bags, etc) should be segregated and should be
collected in separate containers properly labeled providing information about the
radionuclide, its activity and concentration etc.
v. Flammable material should not be kept inside the radioactive waste storage room.
vi. Lids of radioactive waste bins and containers should be securely placed at all times
even when the containers are not in use.
vii. Radioactive waste containing infectious material should be treated to render it noninfectious
prior
to
disposal.
viii.
Record should be maintained in a retrievable manner which includes the date of
disposal, model and serial number of survey instrument used, the background
radiation level, dose rate measured at the surface of each waste container, and the
name of individual who performed the disposal.
ix. Generated radioactive waste should be stored for the purpose of delay and decay
for a minimum period of 6 months prior to its final disposal (irrespective of its
activity and half life) and relevant records should be retained for 3 years.
 
4.7 Warning Signs and Labels
Radiation warning signs and instructions should be displayed prominently outside the
radiation area. These instructions should indicate possible radiation risk and dose level that
may be present in the area. Magenta or black on a yellow background trefoil warning sign
should be used to indicate the presence of ionizing radiations.
5 PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING RADIO-IODINE 
The following procedures should be adopted in all cases where radioiodine is being
handled.
7
The radioiodine should always be stored in a shielded container placed in a
controlled area.
ii. The lead container should be of 1-3 cm thickness to ensure minimum dose rate at
external surface of the container [3].
iii. Vials containing radio-iodine should always be handled in the fume hood.
iv. Receptacles, fabrics, clothing, handkerchiefs etc., likely to become contaminated
should be of disposable nature, whenever practicable.
v.
i.
All items known or suspected to be contaminated should be stored in containers,
which can be readily decontaminated or disposed off. Such items should be
disposed off under the supervision of RPO to ensure the level of contamination is
below the exemption level.
vi. All items of non-disposable nature should be checked under the supervision of
RPO to determine the level of contamination before and after decontamination,
and returned to routine use when declared to be clear by the RPO.
vii. Nursing staff carrying out procedures which may result in contamination of skin
and/or clothing should wear protective gloves and gowns. Their hands and
clothing should be monitored after completion of work and if necessary,
decontamination should be performed under the supervision of RPO, without any
delay.
viii. Catheterization should be considered when the patient is, or likely to be,
incontinent or otherwise incapacitated, to avoid spread of contamination over his
clothes, bedding or floor.
ix. Nappies of infant inpatients administered with radio-iodine should be changed
frequently and the used ones, properly sealed in thick plastic bags, should be
disposed off/ stored for decay.
x. The ideal method for hospitalized patients, administered with greater than 30mCi
radio-iodine, is the use of special toilet suite connected to delay-and-decay tanks.
However, the patient, who is administered with less than 30mCi should use an
ordinary toilet which has been reserved solely for that patient's use during
treatment. 
Special precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of spill of radioactive body fluids 
e.g. vomit, blood, urine and feces etc. Instructions should be given by RPO to take appropriate
action in the event of a spill of radioactive body fluid. These instructions should be prepared
based on following detail regarding minor and major spill of radioactive fluids: 
5.1 Minor Spills
Minor spills include typically less than 100 times exempted quantities of radionuclides
mentioned in ANNEX-I of PNRA regulations on radiation protection (PAK/904). In case of a 
8
minor spill, following procedural steps should be followed:
Inform persons in the affected area that a spill has occurred. Keep them away from
the contaminated place.
ii. Clean up the spill by wearing protective clothing and disposable gloves, using
absorbent paper and place it in a plastic bag for transfer to a labeled waste
container.
iii. Work from outside of the spill towards the centre to avoid spreading of
contamination.
iv. Carry out wipe test or survey for residual contamination as appropriate. Repeat
decontamination, if necessary, until surface contamination monitoring results
reach the dose rate less than 0.02mR/h (0.2 µSv/h) [8].
v. Check hands, clothing, and shoes for presence of contamination, if any.
vi. Report the spill and decontamination results to the person incharge and, if
necessary, to the RPO.
vii. Record necessary details regarding spill and decontamination results. Update the
radionuclide's inventory and waste records accordingly.
i.
5.2 Major Spills 
Major spills involve more than 100 times of exempted quantities of radionuclides or 
contamination of personnel or release of volatile radioactive material. In case of major spills,
following procedural steps should be followed:
Immediately evacuate and cordon off the spill area and post warning sign(s) to
prevent further entry of personnel.
ii. Notify the RPO or person in-charge immediately.
iii. The RPO should take decision for carrying out decontamination of affected area,
personnel and necessary cleanup operations.
iv. Decontaminate personnel by removing their contaminated clothing and flushing
contaminated part of skin with lukewarm water and mild soap.
v.
i.
Follow the decontamination procedures as prescribed earlier for minor spills and
repeat if necessary until contamination monitoring results approaches the dose rate
value of less than 0.02mR/h (0.2 µSv/h) [8].
vi.
If the spill occurs in a laboratory, leave the fume hood running to minimize the
release of volatile radionuclides to adjacent rooms and hallways.
vii. Record the names of persons involved in handling the spill and conducting
necessary recovery operations.
viii. All the persons involved should be monitored for contamination before leaving the
spillage area.
ix. The RPO should arrange for any bioassay measurements, if necessary.
9
x. The RPO should submit a detailed report to PNRA within two months of the
incident.
6 DOSE ADMINISTRATION
There are different methodologies for dose administration that are adopted worldwide.
Usually therapeutic dose of I-131 is administered in a single dose/fraction having activity
about 5550MBq or in multiple doses/fractions of activity 1110MBq per fraction. The patient,
to whom more than 1110MBq of I-131 is administered, should be hospitalized and should not
be discharged until the activity is less than 1110MBq and the measured dose rate at one meter
from the patient is less than 20-50µSv/h (as a good practice). Moreover, if patient-specific
calculations demonstrate that potential total effective dose to any individual around him would
not be greater than 5mSv then he may be discharged from the hospital with specific set of
instructions .
On a specified time, the vial containing radio-iodine which is to be administered is
brought on a cart to the patient's room in its shielded shipping container according to the
transport requirements as specified in PNRA regulations for the safe transport of radioactive
material - PAK/916 [6]. Before dose administration, the nursing staff must ensure that all
aspects of therapy have been explained to the patient and that the patient has signed the therapy
consent form. Once this has been confirmed, the dose can be administered. All contamination
precautions must now be observed. The nursing staff or any other individual entering the
isolation room should wear necessary protective clothing which include; 2 pairs of shoe
covers, 2 pairs of disposable gloves, surgical gown, a mask and optional hair cover.
Greater care must be exercised while administering the radio-iodine dose. Plastic-lined
absorbent pads should be used to cover the dosing table and those areas of patient's body that
may be subjected to any potential spillage. The vial must remain in its shielded container
during administration and a straw should be provided to the patient to drink the radionuclide
contents. Once the dose is administered, the nursing staff should wrap the shielded dose vial,
straw, and any other possibly contaminated items in the absorbent pads and remove them from
the room. The dose vial should be assayed promptly to determine the residual activity so that
the actual administered activity could be calculated. This determination of administered
activity can be used in conjunction with daily exposure rate measurements to determine the
activity remaining in the patient's body. An expression to determine the activity remaining in
the patient's body based on exposure rates is given below:

6.1 Precautionary Measures after Dose Administration 
Following precautionary measures should be followed after the administration of radioiodine
dose
to
the
patient
[7]:
Nursing staff should be trained and strict compliance of radiation protection
requirements must be ensured by the licensee.
ii. Once the patient is admitted in the isolation room after administration of radioiodine

dose, nurse in-charge should inform him about any expected cause of
contamination and duration of its persistence.
iii. Door of the isolation room should be kept closed when the patient is admitted.
iv. Containers should be provided for temporary storage of used utensils and linen,
before they are checked for contamination.
v. The patient should be instructed to attend the collection of excreta preferably
himself and hand it over to the nursing staff.
vi. When prolonged nursing care is necessary, it should be so divided among the ward
staff that the dose received by each individual during his shift is kept to a minimum.
i.
7 DECONTAMINATION
Contamination occurs when a radionuclide spreads beyond its normal place of 
confinement. The radionuclide thus spread may contaminate the environment (air, water,
floors, and surfaces in general) and become partly fixed. It may eventually affect human beings
internally or externally by exposing them to the radiations being emitted. The external
contamination may involve; personnel, clothing and bedding, laboratory equipment and
instruments, working surfaces and other surfaces in the room. Every nuclear medicine centre
handling radio-iodine should establish decontamination team composed of personnel specially
trained in decontamination techniques and possessing all necessary equipment and chemicals
required for decontamination.
7.1 Decontamination of Personnel 
Radio-iodine can affect persons who handle it or those who come in contact with the 
patients carrying radio-iodine (through vomiting, discharges associated with injections,
contaminated bed linen, and excreta). It takes the form of contamination on the hands or other
areas of the skin or scalp. 
Radiation exposure to the skin considerably increases when the skin is externally
contaminated. Moreover, internal contamination increases if radio-iodine passes through open
wounds. If contamination monitor detects contamination of hands or skin, the radioactivity can
be reduced below the detection level by carefully washing the skin with soap. Ordinary soap
has proved to be the best decontaminant in the event of skin contamination. If the
contamination persists, decontamination should be repeated by a decontamination team. One 
11
can try to reduce the radioactivity by washing the skin with an entraining agent (A detergent
ointment with a titanium dioxide base/or saturated potassium permanganate solution).
Chemical treatments of this kind should be applied with care in order not to damage the skin,
and the same is true for the use of light abrasives and scrubbing agents. Every nuclear medicine
center should be equipped with eye-cups and shower facility in the vicinity of change room. 
7.2 Decontamination of Clothing and Bedding
In nuclear medicine centers/hospitals, clothing and bedding usually become
contaminated by perspiration, discharges following injections, incontinence of a patient,
vomiting, or due to some other reasons. It is important to change the contaminated clothing and
bedding immediately and to seal and store them in polythene bags until they can be sent to
laundry. 
Contaminated clothing carries the risk of irradiation of skin and the hazard of internal
exposure, if radio-iodine is inhaled or ingested. It can easily be detected with portable
contamination monitors. Contaminated clothes and bedding or linen should be washed in a
special laundry so as to avoid the washing of contaminated and non contaminated clothing
together. Either soap or a detergent can be used for washing. 
The operation is preceded and followed by extensive rinsing. A hot 1% Citric Acid
solution can also be used. Highly contaminated clothing or linen can be stored for a while to
allow the short-lived radionuclides to decay. If contamination with long-lived radioisotopes
cannot be removed by laundering, the linen should be treated as radioactive waste. After
laundering, clothing should be monitored for residual contamination. Residual levels should
be within the limits specified in ANNEX-I of PAK/904.
7.3 Decontamination of Equipment and Apparatus
The contamination of equipment such as glassware and minor laboratory tools is highly
undesirable as it may lead to contamination of the staff and may also be a source of errors in
analyses and measurements. The degree of contamination of laboratory equipment and
apparatus is often difficult to determine with accuracy. All parts of equipment/instrument
should be assumed as contaminated, prior to conducting decontamination activity. 
After use, porcelain and glassware should be cleaned with appropriate detergents or
chemical decontaminants. Chromic Acid cleaning mixture (K Cr 0  + H S0 ) is most 
2
2 7

4
commonly used chemical decontaminant. Other chemical agents such as Ammonium Citrate
[(NH ) C H O ], Penta-sodium Tri-phosphate (Na P O ) and Ammonium Fluoride (NH HF ) 
4 3 6 5 7
5 3 10
4
2
can also be used. Metal objects should first be cleaned with good detergents; if contamination
persists then complexing agents (Acitrate-Edetic Acid mixture), Ammonium Fluoride, or
dilute acid solutions may be used. Ordinary metal cleaners are usually used to clean stainless
steel equipment/instrument. If contamination still persists, a mild abrasive such as a mixture of 
12
Nitric Acid and 1% Sodium Fluoride can be employed.
 If above methods prove inadequate, one can resort to sand-blasting and/or ultrasonic
techniques. The choice of method depends primarily on the type of equipment and whether or
not it can withstand the treatment which might lead to the loss of material. If the contaminant is
a short-lived radionuclide, the equipment/instrument which proves difficult to decontaminate
must be stored until the radioactivity has decayed; otherwise it must be disposed off as a
radioactive waste.
7.4 Decontamination of Surfaces and Floors
Contamination of working surfaces, floors, and corridors may originate from spills,
settling of aerosols present in the air and the transfer of contamination through shoes. It may
also result from an incident involving contamination such as overturning of radioactive
solutions or substances and vomiting etc. The result of such incident may be the contamination
of surfaces, floors, skin, clothing and bedding. The contaminating material may also form a
suspension in the air and lead to internal exposure if inhaled.

Working surfaces and floors should be periodically checked for contamination and
should be decontaminated whenever the levels exceed allowable limits. The cleaning-up
operation should usually be carried out by sweeping the surface with a broom or brush wetted
with a suitable agent, or by mopping it with a damp cloth. Dry sweeping should always be
avoided as it may result into the contamination becoming airborne. Linoleum-covered or
painted floors should be decontaminated by means of detergents, care being taken to avoid the
spreading of contamination. If contamination persists, the floor coverings or paint must be
removed. 
When a radioactive solution is spilt, the first step is to prevent the contamination from
spreading. The liquid should be covered with sawdust, absorbent material or dry rags
immediately. Decontamination can be carried out by mopping the surface with a damp cloth,
by ordinary washing, or by scrubbing. If a patient vomits within five hours of administrating
radio-iodine dose, all affected floors, bedding, linen, and persons around him must undergo
same decontamination procedures as are applied in the event of spillage of radio-iodine. 
7.5 Wipe Test 
Wipe tests are used to determine the amount and level of contamination present in the
affected area, however, it does not measure the entire contamination that is present. The
procedure followed for wipe test consists of the following steps:  
i.
Put on disposable gloves. 
ii. Wipe the filter paper or a cotton swab of appropriate size across the affected area.
Dry wipes should preferably be used. 
13
iii. For determination of contamination on the surface of a package, an area of 300
cm2 should be wiped.
iv. For determination of contamination on a working surface or a floor, an area of 100
cm2 should be wiped.
v. Take the activity counts of a background sample and the test sample using a well
shape counter with Sodium Iodide (NaI) detector. 
vi. Compare this reading with the applicable threshold levels; carryout the
decontamination procedure, if it exceeds the applicable threshold level.  
8 CONTROL OF VISITORS
The management of the facility is responsible to protect the visitors from undue
exposure to radiations. Following precautionary measures should be adopted for the
protection of personnel visiting the patients:
i. Visitors should not be allowed to visit their patients within 48 hours after
administration of radio-iodine. Un-necessary visits/meetings should be
discouraged.
ii. Pregnant women and children under the age of 18 should not be permitted to visit
the patient admitted in isolation room.
iii. The duration of visit should be as short as possible.
iv. Visitors should be advised to keep themselves at a reasonable distance from the
patient (preferably at a distance of about 2m or behind the shielded screens).
v. Visitors should be advised not to kiss the patient and not even eat, drink or smoke
in the patient's room.
vi. Visitors should also be advised to avoid using the toilet or sink in the patient's
room.
9 RADIATION PROTECTION PROGRAM
The management of a facility/nuclear medicine center must ensure that a Radiation Protection
Program is developed, documented, implemented and regularly reviewed to ensure safety in
all practices in which radioisotopes are used. The radiation protection program of the facility
should include the following:
i. Work practices;
ii.
Roles and responsibilities of RPO, Nursing Staff etc;
iii. Radiation monitoring requirements and availability of monitoring equipment ;
iv. Control of incidents involving contamination;
v.
Storage and transportation arrangements of radiopharmaceuticals; 
vi. Radiation protection measures applicable in isolation rooms;
vii. Inventory control and records of radiopharmaceuticals; and
14
viii. Any other requirement that may have bearing on safety.
10 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
 
Each facility/nuclear medicine center is responsible to ensure that emergency plan for 
the incidents and emergencies involving radionuclides is developed and effectively
implemented. Emergency procedures for the implementation of emergency plan should be
identified while developing the emergency plan of the facility. Following items should be
considered during preparation of emergency procedures:
Instructions on  immediate actions that need to be taken to protect human life,
limit injury and provide first aid where required;
ii.
i.
Instructions on immediate actions needed to bring the incident under control,
including details on  actions necessary to prevent further spread of contamination
(if this possibility arises);
iii. Instructions for personnel involved to report the incident to  RPO or his designated
alternate;
iv. Instructions for the RPO or his designated alternate  to communicate this
information and any follow-up on the developing situation to PNRA;
v.
Lists containing names, addresses and telephone numbers of responsible
personnel required in the event of an emergency (these should be checked and
updated at least once every six months and/or whenever changes in the
arrangements are made);
vi. Instructions to be followed when safety procedures or working rules are not
sufficient; and
vii. Instructions on emergency response actions following radioactive spillage,
vomiting, fire, flood, explosion or any other disaster or incident within the facility.

RADIATION SAFETY IN INDUSTRIAL RADIOGRAPHY
ABSTRACT
Industrial radiography is of significant importance in non destructive testing. It 
involves application of ionizing radiations e.g. X-rays and gamma rays to verify the 
physical integrity of items, equipment and structures such as vessels, pipes, welded 
joints, casting and other devices. Industrial radiography poses negligible risk if it is 
performed in a safe manner. However, experience shows that incidents involving 
industrial radiography sources have sometimes resulted in high doses to workers, causing 
severe health consequences such as radiation burns and, in a few cases, death. Members 
of the public have also suffered radiation overexposures when radioactive sources used 
for industrial radiography are not properly controlled or regulated. All such incidents 
demonstrate the necessity to have effective radiation safety infrastructure in place within 
the facilities; complemented with strong regulatory oversight to ensure highest level of 
safety. In order to control/eliminate such incidents in radiation facilities, PNRA has 
established requirements in the form of regulations called "Regulations on Radiation 
Protection" (PAK/904). This regulatory guide provides guidance to the licensee(s) and 
worker(s) to fulfill the purpose of these regulations effectively.

1 INTRODUCTION
The applications of ionizing radiation bring many benefits to mankind ranging from 
power generation to uses in medicine, industry, agriculture and research. One of the foremost 
industrial applications of such radiation is the use of sources to verify the physical integrity of 
items, equipment and structures through non-destructive testing. The structural integrity of 
such equipment and structures affects not only the safety and quality of the products but also 
the protection of the workers, public and the environment. 
Radiography is a process in which radiation passes through an object/material under 
investigation and strikes at photographic film or some other digital detection system placed 
behind it. There is a partial absorption of the radiation beam as it passes through the 
object/material and it gives the detailed information in the form of final image on a 
photographic film or a digital detection system as illustrated in Figure 1.
The ionizing radiation such as high energy gamma and X-rays are used for industrial 
radiography purposes worldwide because of their significant penetrating power. Apart from Xray generators, examples of sealed radioactive sources (SRS) emitting gamma rays, used in 
industrial radiography, include Cobalt (Co-60), Iridium (Ir-192) and Cesium (Cs-137) etc.
Industrial radiography usually produces high doses and if a person is accidentally 
exposed to primary beam or comes in close contact with an unshielded radiography source (i.e. 
SRS), he might receive a dose that could result in severe deterministic health effects. 
Therefore, it requires high degree of professionalism which can only be achieved through 
effective management system, compliance with regulatory requirements, regulatory oversight 
and effective training/re-training of radiographers. A need to provide guidance to the 
licensee(s) of industrial radiography facilities, has been felt since long, to facilitate them in 
complying with the requirements regarding radiation protection. This regulatory guide has 
been prepared on the bases of the requirements established under regulation(s) 9, 10, 20, 25 to 
1
Figure 1 : Radiography Process
30, 32 and 33 of "Regulations on Radiation Protection" - PAK/904 [1]. Moreover, guidance on 
the implementation of requirements of relevant regulation(s) of "Regulations on Management 
of a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency" - PAK/914 [2] and "Regulations for the Safe 
Transport of Radioactive Material" - PAK/916 [3] have also been provided in this guide.
2 OBJECTIVE
The objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance to licensee(s) and worker(s) 
regarding radiation safety in industrial radiography.
3 SCOPE
The guidance provided in this regulatory guide is applicable to the licensee(s) using 
radiation source(s) (i.e. SRS emitting gamma rays and X-ray generators) for the purpose of 
industrial radiography whether performed in a shielded enclosure or in a partially closed or 
open site.
4 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The overall responsibility for radiation safety lies with the licensee. Specific duties and 
the day to day responsibilities for safe operation of radiography equipment, however, lie with a 
range of people, including management, the radiation protection officer (RPO), radiography 
crew, and, for site radiography work, the client is responsible for the premises where the site 
radiography work is carried out. All the duties and responsibilities should be identified, in 
writing, and agreed to by all the relevant personnel.
The licensee is responsible for the establishment and implementation of technical and 
organizational measures necessary to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and 
safety of the workers, public and the environment from harmful effects of radiations. The 
licensee should develop, implement, and maintain an overall management system of the 
facility that defines reporting hierarchy and responsibilities of all relevant individuals. General 
responsibilities of a licensee, RPO and the radiography crew may include the following:
[4] 4.1 Responsibilities of an Owner/Licensee
The owner/licensee of an industrial radiography facility should:
i. Develop detailed operating procedures and working rules prior to commencement 
of industrial radiography operation for the first time;
ii. Ensure that necessary infrastructure is available to enable the implementation of 
routine/emergency procedures and working rules, including provision of barriers, 
interlocks and warning signs;
iii. Designate a Radiation Protection Officer (RPO) as per criteria prescribed in PNRA
Regulations (PAK/904). RPO should have sufficient professional and technical 
2
training enabling him/her to readily comprehend and carry out assigned duties; 
iv. Ensure that the surveillance of radiography equipment is performed prior to its first 
use and at periodic intervals as recommended by the supplier to ensure that all 
interlocks, shutters and control mechanisms function normally and that no 
components are unacceptably worn or damaged. Surveillance record thus 
generated should be maintained and made available to the Authority, when 
required;
v. Ensure that if damage to equipment or variation in its radiation pattern is observed, 
the equipment should not be allowed to be used further until inspected by an 
RPO/supplier/PNRA inspector. Once repaired, the equipment should be tested for 
its intended function in accordance with its technical specifications, before re-use, 
if necessary. Record of such repairs should be maintained and made available to the 
Authority, when required;
vi. Ensure that radiation emergency plan, radiation protection program, security plan, 
etc. are prepared in accordance with regulatory requirements and are submitted to 
the Authority for review and approval. All such plans and program should be 
integrated into the overall management system of the facility and made available 
during the radiography work;
vii. Ensure, prior to operation of industrial radiography equipment at a site other than 
its own premises, that the person responsible for that site/premises is consulted and 
advised to:
a. Take necessary precautions required for workers in the vicinity, and details of 
the operator responsible for radiographic operation at site;
b. Identify the responsible person nominated for liaison between operator and 
other workers at site so that the directions given by the operator to maintain 
radiation safety are followed.
viii. Ensure that necessary supervision is provided in a supervised area so that workers 
and public are protected from potential exposure;
ix. Ensure that a radiography crew (i.e. operator/radiographer) is composed of 
technically competent individuals (other than RPO) to cater for any unforeseen 
incident during radiography in the shielded enclosure or open site;
x. Ensure that radiography crew and other facility/site personnel who may be 
exposed to radiation are properly instructed about radiation hazards associated 
with their work, and appraised of precautions necessary to limit the exposure in

Authority in regulations PAK/904, and that all radiation exposures are kept As Low 
As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP);
xii. Ensure that the measurements, investigations and assessments necessary to 
monitor the exposure of workers, from radiography operations, are made and 
relevant reports/record is maintained in a documented form;
3
xiii. Ensure that source movement record/log is maintained for all the SRS under 
his/her control, so that an updated record of the source location is readily available.
[4] 4.2 Responsibilities of a Radiation Protection Officer (RPO)
The Radiation Protection Officer (RPO) of a facility should:
i. Have acquired sufficient knowledge of radiation protection and of potential 
hazards associated with radiography equipment so that he may undertake the 
measurements, investigations, assessments and other duties assigned;
ii. Be familiar with:
a. Applicable regulatory requirements regarding industrial radiography;

iv. Instruct and train the radiography crew, as necessary, in the safe use of equipment 
and appropriate radiation safety measures;
v. Ensure that each radiation worker, who may be exposed to radiation during the 
course of radiography, uses appropriate radiation monitoring devices, including 
personal dosimeter;
vi. Ensure that all necessary personal monitoring devices and radiation survey meters 
are available and in good working condition and are calibrated on regular intervals;
vii. Ensure that personal dosimeters are issued and used by all the workers and their 
received doses are properly assessed and record is maintained in a proper 
documented form;
viii. Ensure that all the equipment e.g. radiation monitoring devices, survey meters, 
source containers, shutters, source control mechanisms, interlocks are inspected 
and tested regularly;
ix. Ensure that the physical security requirements for source storage are properly 
implemented;
x. Ensure that radiography equipment is properly stored, with the source(s) located in 
fully shielded position, by monitoring at appropriate intervals;
xi. Ensure that the requirements for safe transport of radiography sources are met.
[4] 4.3 Responsibilities of Radiography Crew
The radiography crew is composed of operators/radiographers qualified and certified for 
conducting radiography operations. The crew is usually lead by a senior radiographer and 
assisted by other crew members. Asenior radiographer (supervisor) should have the following 
responsibilities:
i. Ensure that the crew is familiar with the basic knowledge of radiation protection; 
4
ii. Be familiar with radiography equipment and its use, approved working rules and 
applicable routine/emergency procedures and operate the equipment in
accordance with approved procedures/working rules;
iii. Ensure that source(s) (SRS/X-ray generator) movement record is maintained with 
the following details:
a. Identification number of the source(s) and/or its container;
b. Radioisotope and its current activity (in case of SRS);
c. Location of sites where the source(s) is to be used;
d. Date and time of source transfer/return;
e. Name of the person, in whose name source(s) is issued.
iv. Ensure that all interlocks, shielding, collimator, warning signs, barriers and other 
protective devices are properly positioned, prior to operating the equipment, so that 
undue exposure of those not involved in radiography could be avoided, in 
particular, for partially enclosed and site radiography;
v. Ensure that radiography equipment is not operated, if appropriate survey meter and 
personal dosimeter is not available;
vi. Ensure, by using an appropriate radiation survey meter, that source (i.e. SRS) has 
been returned to its fully shielded position after the completion of radiography;
vii. Ensure that source (i.e. SRS) control or shutter mechanism is locked or otherwise 
secured in a fully shielded position and all port plugs are firmly secured in place, 
while returning the gamma-radiography equipment to the store;
viii. Ensure that radiography equipment is not operated, if it is known or suspected to be 
malfunctioning/deteriorated/damaged and immediately report such circumstances 
to the owner/licensee or RPO for appropriate corrective/investigative action;
ix. Ensure that the operation of radiography equipment is immediately stopped, by 
returning the source (i.e. SRS) to its fully shielded position, in the following 
circumstances:
a. If malfunction occurs during radiography operation; 
b. If any person other than the radiography crew enters an area where the dose rate 
exceeds or might exceed the allowable regulatory limits;
c. If the only available survey meter fails to function.
x. Promptly take appropriate measures, in accordance with the approved emergency 
procedure, to bring the situation under control in the event of a radiation incident. 
The assisting crew members should bear the following responsibilities:
i. Carry out the duties/tasks as are assigned/delegated by the supervisor, in 
accordance with the established local rules;
ii. Operate radiography equipment only under the direct supervision of concerned 
supervisor;
iii. Take over the responsibilities insofar, in the event of a supervisor being unable to
5
carry out his duties, by ensuring the exposure to himself and other crew members 
remains within the regulatory limits.
[1] 5 INDIVIDUALMONITORING 
Individual monitoring is a measure of radiation dose(s) to individual(s) for the estimation 
of exposure to radiation and the interpretation of corresponding results. Licensee/owner should 
ensure that radiation doses to radiography crew are assessed on regular intervals to ensure that 
doses are kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) and are below the limits of 
PAK/904.
Individual monitoring is recommended for the individual(s) who routinely work in a 
controlled area. It provides information about the magnitude and pattern of doses received by 
an individual. Such information is important for a number of reasons; which are described 
below:
i. It enables to exercise control over radiation exposure of an individual;
ii. It demonstrates whether doses are being kept ALARA;
iii. It contributes to highlight unexpected high doses; enables to investigate the 
circumstances of overexposure; and helps to determine corrective actions to be 
taken, if necessary;
iv. It indicates the efficacy of radiation protection measures applied during routine 
work practices and measure improvement and/or deterioration in current work 
practices;
v. It also highlights good or bad work practices, status of radiography equipment, and 
degradation of shielding or engineered safety systems.
The ultimate choice of the type of dosimeter, to be used by the radiographers, should be 
made by the RPO in consultation with a qualified expert in radiation dosimetry, if possible. In 
addition to fulfill various technical requirements, the parameters such as its availability, 
initial/running cost, its robustness, and applicable regulatory requirements should also be 
considered while choosing a specific dosimeter.
5.1 Types of Dosimeters
Dosimeter is an instrument used for recording radiation dose to an individual. Dosimeters 
are used not only during routine working in a radiation area but are also used in the event of an 
emergency or an incident. There are two types of dosimeter which can be used for a short-term 
as well as for routine dose monitoring. These dosimeters are classified as active dosimeters and 
passive dosimeters. Necessary detail regarding these dosimeters is given below:
Ÿ Active or direct-reading dosimeters are used for short-term (from minutes up to few 
hours) dose assessment and provide an instantaneous dose and/or alarm at pre-set 
dose levels or dose-rate. These can be very useful in restricting exposures during 
6
industrial radiography. The examples of direct reading dosimeters are Pen 
Dosimeters and Electronic Personal Dosimeters (EPD). Pen Dosimeters are always 
used after calibration through its calibrator. Active dosimeters are intended to be used 
for providing real time indication of the dose being received during radiography 
and/or for providing a warning for high dose-rate. Common measuring range of such 
dosimeters is from one (1) µSv/hr to 100 mSv/hr.
Ÿ Dosimeters used for routine monitoring are referred as passive dosimeters i.e. they 
require to be processed by a specialized dosimetry service provider, on periodic 
intervals, to assess the dose received by an individual. Examples of passive 
dosimeters used for dose assessment due to beta, gamma, X-rays and neutron 
radiations are Film Badges (FB) and Thermo-Luminescent Dosimeters (TLD). It is 
preferable to get such dosimeters (FB/TLD) read from an accredited dosimetry 
service provider on monthly basis for the assessment of dose received by the 
worker(s).
Figure -2 given below, illustrate the examples of various types of (active and passive) 
dosimeters.
5.2 Precautions forDosimeter(s)
To ensure that a dosimeter provides an accurate assessment of the dose(s) to a 
radiographer, following guidelines should be followed:
i. Dosimeter(s) should be worn (only) by the radiographer, to whom it is issued;
ii. It should be worn at all times, when carrying out work with radiation;
7
Film Badge TLD
Pen Dosimeter Calibrator EPD
Figure 2: Types of Dosimeters
iii. It should preferably be worn on chest or belt or in accordance with the 
recommendations of dosimetry service provider;
iv. It should be worn on inside of the apron, in case if lead apron is used during work;
v. Whenever, hands are exposed to radiation, ring dosimeters should be worn facing 
towards inside of the hand;
vi. The measuring element should be correctly positioned in the dosimeter holder, 
both for TLD and FB;
vii. Care should be taken to avoid damaging the measuring element of the dosimeter 
because of their sensitivity (i.e. dosimeters must be protected against water, high 
temperature/pressure and physical impact);
viii. It should not be exposed to radiation when not being worn by a radiographer (it 
should be stored in an area away from radiation sources);
ix. Dosimeter(s) (TLD/FB) should be immediately sent for processing by the 
dosimetry service provider after the end of each term;
x. Damaged dosimeter should not be used. If a radiographer suspects that the 
dosimeter is damaged or is exposed to radiation when not in use, RPO should be 
informed accordingly;
xi. The RPO should inform PNRAand the dosimetry service provider about the lost or 
damaged dosimeters and its replacement should be arranged as soon as possible.
5.3 Unusual Dose
Radiation doses received by radiographers are expected to be low, usually not exceeding 
2-3 mSv in a year, provided that all safety measures/procedures are implemented. However, if 
an unusual high dose, e.g. several mSv in a year, is reported for a single dosimeter or 
radiographer then it is not usual and should not go un-checked. It might be the result of high 
workload, a maintenance activity or enactment of an emergency plan. It also indicates poor 
work practices or inadequate radiation protection arrangements by the licensee. Such 
deficiencies, if confirmed, should be rectified and reason(s) for any unusual dose should be 
investigated by the licensee/RPO. Records of such investigations should be maintained and 
PNRAshould be informed accordingly.
5.4 Investigation Levels
PNRA Regulations on Radiation Protection (PAK/904) require that the licensee should 
establish investigation levels of dose(s) to individual(s). Such investigation levels are specific 
values of dose which, if exceeded, requires to be investigated. The purpose of such 
investigation is to determine the circumstances that gave rise to higher dose(s) and to make a 
judgment whether this dose is as low as reasonably achievable or not. It is important to note that 
the numerical value of a dose investigation level, established by the licensee, is always a 
fraction of a particular dose limit.
8
Such investigation levels and corresponding actions to be taken, in the event of these 
being exceeded, may also be established by the Authority. Although, they are not regulatory 
binding, however, their use as means of ensuring safety of workers should not be ignored.
5.5 OverExposure
An overexposure is considered to have occurred when a particular dose limit, specified 
by PNRA, has been exceeded. Overexposure is most likely to occur as a result of an incident or 
accident. An individual or a radiographer who suspects that he had an overexposure, should 
immediately inform the RPO/Licensee. In case of an overexposure, the RPO/Licensee should 
immediately inform PNRA and carry out a detailed investigation to determine the reasons, 
including an assessment of dose(s) received by the individual/radiographer, and final 
conclusion thereof. The report of such investigation should be submitted to PNRA, as soon as 
possible. PNRAmay also conduct further investigations, if so required.
5.6 Health Surveillance
The Licensee/owner should develop and execute a program for health surveillance of 
workers and should make necessary arrangements for their health surveillance [1]. Initial 
health surveillance should be performed to assess whether a worker possesses an adequate 
level of fitness for the intended tasks and that he/she is psychologically suitable to work with 
radiation source(s). Whereas, the licensee/owner should make arrangements for annual health 
surveillance (medical examination) of the workers working in a controlled area to ensure that 
their health remains satisfactory. Such program should be based on general principles of 
occupational health as described in "Factories Act 1934" currently enforced in Pakistan. 
[5] 6 GAMMA RADIOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT
High activity sealed radioactive source(s), housed in a shielded exposure device, are 
commonly used in gamma radiography equipment. The source remains in the shielded 
exposure device unless used. It is exposed by remotely moving it from the shielded exposure 
device (e.g. by using push–pull wires) directly into an attached guide tube. It remains in the 
guide tube for the desired exposure time, after which it is drawn back into the shielded 
exposure device.
The equipment used for gamma radiography typically consists of several components 
such as a remote wind-out mechanism (often called a crank), connected to the radiography 
source (often called a 'pigtail') inside a shielded exposure device, which is directly connected 
to the guide tube. Sealed sources used for gamma radiography are normally part of a source 
assembly (the pigtail) that is usually connected to the drive cable in source projection type 
systems. The design and operation of these various components of gamma radiography 
equipment are interrelated.
Gamma radiography equipment should be selected in a way to ensure uninterrupted 
9
operation during radiography. Following features should be considered while selection of 
gamma radiography equipment:
i. It should be durable i.e. resistant to corrosion, radiation and high temperature;
ii. It should be capable to prevent the passage of water, sand and other foreign 
materials into its critical parts.
6.1 Exposure Device
The exposure device (also called as gamma projector) incorporates various safety 
devices and features designed to reduce the risk of human error or equipment malfunction. The 
licensee/owner should ensure to use an exposure device that has been designed in compliance 
with the applicable international standards to ensure that minimum safety requirements are met 
and that the device and source combination is suitable for use for radiography purposes. It 
should be ensured that an appropriate source with maximum activity permitted is used in the 
exposure device (quoted for each radionuclide) for which it is designed. Since, design 
specifications of most exposure devices also meet the requirements for a Type B(U) transport 
package as specified in PNRA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material - 
PAK/916, therefore, these can also be used as transport package for the transportation of 
radiography source(s). 
Each exposure device (gamma projector), as illustrated in Figure-3, should be 
permanently and clearly labeled with the following details: 
i. Radiation warning sign (trefoil) and the word “RADIOACTIVE”;
ii. Name of radionuclide and its maximum activity for which it is designed;
iii. Name of radionuclide (SRS) in use, its serial number, activity along with reference 
date;
iv. Type of container i.e. B(U) or B(M);
v. Licensee's name, address and contact number(s) for emergency situation.
The exposure device should have a locking mechanism. The locking should be designed 
on the principle of "fail-to-lock", if the source is not in its secured position. It should have an 
indicator to show whether the device is locked or not. The exposure device should be of such 
design that the source can only be moved, from its secured position, by a remote control 
(crank). When the source is in secured position, dose rate should not exceed 2 mSv/h on the 
10
Figure 3: Exposure Device (Gamma Projector)
surface of the device and 0.01 mSv/h at a distance of one meter from the surface of the device. 
The remote control (crank) should also be capable to indicate clearly whether the source is in 
secured position or in exposed/working position.
6.2 Drive Cable and Guide Tube
Ancillary equipment such as drive cable and guide tube are used to maximize the 
distance between the radiographer and source i.e. SRS. It has to be ensured that drive cable and 
guide tube are capable to withstand with the stresses caused during the use of gamma projector. 
Connections between the drive cable and source, and among the lengths/pieces of guide tube 
should be of such design that source can move freely when connections are properly made. The 
source should not become loose or stuck in the guide tube. It should be ensured that guide tube 
and openings of the exposure device are provided with covers to prevent dust from entering 
into the device.
6.3 Recommendations for the Use of Drive Cable and Guide Tube 
Licensee should ensure to use such gamma radiography equipment and accessories i.e. 
drive cable and guide tube which comply with the following recommendations:
i. Such guide tube should be used through which the source can move freely . Design 
of the end cap at exposure end of the guide tube should prevent inadvertent release 
of the source when it is fully projected;
ii. Open end of the guide tube should be caped to prevent ingress of dirt, grit and 
moisture and, if it is flexible, it should withstand repeated flexures without 
suffering permanent distortion. It should be capable to recover from any 
temporary distortion caused by a compressive load or flexure;
iii. Exposure end of the guide tube should be clamped in position during exposure 
without affecting free movement of cable and source, and should be fitted with a 
collimator;
iv. Where a cable is used to move the source, the coupling should ensure that during 
radiography work, the source (or pigtail) is not detached inadvertently;
v. Drive cable should typically be 7-15 m and the guide tubes should be 2–6.5 m long 
according to the actual conditions of exposure to ensure that source is controlled 
from a location where dose rate is minimum;
vi. The radiographer must know the distance through which the source is projected 
from its fully shielded position, through the wind out mechanism;
vii. In case the source is moved pneumatically, the guide tube should be provided with 
damping mechanisms, at both ends, to protect the source from damage.
6.4 Collimators
Collimators are beam limiting devices and are used to narrow/direct the beam of 
radiations in a particular direction. Radiographers should ensure that collimators are used, 
whenever possible, to reduce radiation levels and subsequent doses. Collimators are usually 
11
made of lead, tungsten or depleted uranium, and they can provide either panoramic or 
directional beams. The licensee should ensure that the collimators are compatible with the 
source assembly, so as to avoid the source to be stuck.
6.5 Instructions forTesting and Maintenance of Radiography Equipment
The maintenance consists of complete disassembly of the equipment and a detailed 
inspection of all the components. Worn or damaged parts should be replaced, wherever 
required, and suitable lubricant should be applied. The licensee should develop and 
implement a program for periodic testing/surveillance and preventive maintenance of 
radiography equipment and its accessories in the light of manufacturer's instructions. It should 
be ensured that only vendor or specially trained radiographer(s) always perform 
testing/maintenance of radiography equipment. Records of all maintenance, including the 
replacement of parts, should be kept.
Periodic testing/surveillance of the following typical items/devices should be 
considered in the program:
i. Exposure device, to ensure that:
a. Fittings and fasteners are tight;
b. Locking mechanism functions properly;
c. Radiation levels are normal;
d. Connections of guide tube and remote control (crank) are secure;
e. Pigtail connection to drive cable is secured, using a wear gauge.
ii. Remote control (crank) and guide tube(s), to ensure that:
a. Fittings are tight;
b. There are no indications of crushing, kinks or dents;
c. Drive cable can move freely;
d. Source (pigtail) tips are not worn through.
iii. Safety interlock components and emergency stop devices of shielded
enclosure(s), to ensure their normal operation;
iv. Inspection of critical safety components of radiography equipment and its 
accessories, at least once a year;
v. Leak test of SRS as per method and frequency recommended by the source vendor 
or manufacturer.
[4] 7 X- RAYRADIOGRAPHYEQUIPMENT
The most common type of X-ray generator used as radiography equipment is the 
conventional X-ray Tube; however, Linear Accelerators (LINACs) and Cyclotrons are also 
used in few specialized applications. Some typical examples of X-ray generators are 
illustrated in Figure-4.
12
13
X-ray generators are mostly used for performing panoramic (radial beam) and 
directional exposures. The X-ray tube is connected by a cable to the control panel, which 
provides means for pre-selection and indication of operating parameters. Dose to a 
radiographer can be affected by the cable length, operating parameters (volts-kV and currentmA) and local shielding around the device being radiographed. Licensee should only use such 
X-ray generators that satisfy the following minimum safety standards.
7.1 Electrical Safety
Electrical safety in an X-ray generator indirectly contributes to radiation safety, since 
electrical faults in X-ray generators can sometimes result in serious accidents with 
radiological consequences. In particular, all metallic items including casings, interconnecting 
cables, power supply unit (transformer/generator), control equipment, tube assembly, 
warning signals, other safety devices should be electrically bonded together (earth bonding) 
and connected to earth (grounded). Advice on all electrical matters, as well as on inspection 
and testing, should be obtained from a qualified electrical engineer or specialized service 
engineer, if required.
7.2 Cable Length
Where radiography cannot be carried out in a shielded enclosure, cable lengths should 
typically be not less than 20 meters for X-ray generators up to 300 kV and longer for higher 
energy equipment.
7.3 Collimators and Beam Filters
The licensee should ensure that the X-ray generators used for directional radiography 
should, wherever practicable, be fitted with collimators (sometimes called cones or 
diaphragms) to limit the beam size to the minimum compatible with the radiographic 
technique. Beam filters should be used to match the filtration with the work being undertaken. 
Figure 4: X-ray Generator used for Industrial Radiography
14
7.4 Control Panel
The licensee should consider following features in a control panel while selecting an Xray equipment. It should bear:
i. A label incorporating radiation warning sign (trefoil), a legend indicating that Xrays are emitted when the equipment is operating and a warning label (in a local 
language) prohibiting unauthorized use;
ii. A key switch to prevent unauthorized use of equipment. The key should be 
removable only when the switch is in 'OFF' or 'Standby' position (i.e. it should not 
be possible to lock the system in 'ON' condition). Key positions should be clearly 
marked;
iii. A labeled warning light (fail-safe) which indicates that the equipment is 
powered/energized (i.e. ready to emit X-rays);
iv. A separate labeled warning light (fail-safe) which indicates that the equipment is 
actually emitting X-rays;
v. Atimer that controls the exposure duration or 'ON' switch that requires continuous 
pressure by a radiographer to maintain the generation of X-rays;
vi. Indicators that show the kilovolts (kV) and the current in milli-amperes (mA) 
when the X-ray beam is 'ON';
vii. Aclearly labeled means to immediately terminate the generation of radiation.
7.5 X-ray Tube Head
The licensee should ensure that the X-ray tube head is supported in a suitable stand or 
clamped in a position to prevent it from inadvertently moving. Leakage radiation (i.e. leakage 
that passes through the sides of the device rather than pass from the beam aperture) should be 
restricted by good design and construction and its level should be specified by the 
manufacturer. The penetrating power of leakage radiation depends on the kilo voltage and is 
particularly significant above 500 kV. Maximum dose rates due to leakage radiation at the 
surface of the device and at one (1) meter from the X ray target should be obtained from the 
manufacturer/vendor. Typical maximum dose rate values from leakage radiation arising from 
commercial X-ray tubes are up to 100 μSv/h at one (1) meter from the target. 
7.6 Flash X-ray Units
Some X-ray based radiography equipment emit very short pulses of X-rays and the 
exposure duration is set in terms of number of pulses. Such radiography equipment are called 
flash X-ray units. These are often small, portable, battery driven units and are mainly used for 
the radiography of items of low density or very low wall thickness. Whereas, large such units 
are less often used in shielded enclosures where high output and extremely short exposure is 
required. The licensee should apply the same precautions that are used for ordinary X-ray 
equipment along with any additional safety precautions as determined on the bases of dose 
assessment. Most survey/dose meters are not suitable for the measurement of dose around 
flash X-ray units because exposure duration is extremely short and their response time is 
relatively slow. Therefore, it is advisable to use suitable integrating survey/dose meters. 
7.7 Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of X-ray Equipment 
In order to ensure continued radiography operations, the licensee should arrange both; 
the routine surveillance as well as formal inspections/maintenance of X-ray equipment 
(including all accessories) to be performed by the manufacturer/vendor or a qualified 
engineer. Licensee should ensure that equipment is not modified without prior assessment of 
the implications of the modification on its original design and the safety assessment. Any parts 
to be replaced should be procured from the authorized merchant in order to ensure designed 
safety specifications/parameters.
The licensee should perform following periodic surveillance activities for their X-ray 
equipment:
i. Checks to ensure electrical safety i.e. earth bonding and electrical insulation of 
cables;
ii. Cleaning/replacing of filters, if any, of cooling system(s);
iii. Checks to ensure there is no leakage from the X-ray tube head;
iv. Checks to ensure that cables are in good working condition and wires are not 
frayed/exposed;
v. Tests on interlocks and emergency cut-out switches;
vi. Tests on permanently installed radiation detectors inside radiography enclosures;
vii. Any other tests and maintenance as recommended by the manufacturer/vendor.
The licensee should establish, maintain and implement a program for maintenance of the 
equipment. It should be ensured that only manufacturer/vendor or specifically trained 
operator(s) perform such maintenance. The maintenance should be performed at least once 
per year or more, if the equipment is used in severe environmental conditions, such as 
excessive dirt, extreme humidity or is frequently moved within/outside the premises. Nonfunctioning or damaged parts of the equipment should be replaced at the earliest, whenever 
necessary. Record(s) of all maintenance activities, including replacement of parts, should be 
maintained and made available during the inspection(s).
8 TYPES OF INDUSTRIAL RADIOGRAPHY
 Industrial radiography is carried out under a variety of exposure conditions. The 
radiography, with respect to exposure conditions, is generally classified into two categories 
i.e. radiography in a shielded enclosure (specially designed exposure room/bunker) and a site 
radiography (performed in the field or in a client's premises). Owner/Licensee is responsible 
to ensure protection of workers, public and the environment, in both the exposure situations. 
In addition to the responsibilities as specified in Section 4.1, following recommendations 
should also be implemented during both types of radiography activities:
[4,5] 8.1 Recommendations forShielded Enclosure 
Ashielded enclosure is an enclosed space specially designed and engineered to provide 
15
adequate shielding against ionizing radiations to the workers and other individuals in the 
vicinity. The enclosure should be designed to keep all, direct and scattered, radiations arising 
from radiographic exposures within itself by permitting operation of radiography equipment, 
from outside, by a remote means (i.e. crank or a control panel). It should incorporate 
engineering controls to prevent or to minimize the potential exposure of workers who might 
enter the enclosure when the source(s) (i.e. SRS or an X-ray generator) is exposed or 
energized. The licensee should ensure that industrial radiography is always performed inside a 
shielded enclosure, whenever it is reasonably practicable. No one should remain inside the 
enclosure during exposure. Following precautions should be taken for the radiography 
performed in a shielded enclosure:
i. The bunker should be constructed in a way that the doors/ports, walls, floor and 
the ceiling, form a complete shielded enclosure;
ii. The shielding should be sufficient to ensure that during exposure; instantaneous 
dose rate outside the enclosure should be in the range of 2.5 - 20 Sv/hr at one (1) 
foot from the walls;
iii. Shielding and the location of enclosure should be such that no worker or a member 
of public should receive an effective dose in excess of 5 mSv and 1 mSv per year 
respectively from exposures carried out within it;
iv. There should be a single access point for the radiography enclosure with a warning 
notice/sign displayed at it. A warning light should also be provided capable of 
illuminating during exposure and visible from outside the enclosure;
v. Interlocks should be installed at the access point of the enclosure capable of 
activating a visible and audible alarm if any interlock is opened/bypassed during 
the exposure;
vi. Door and panels covering access apertures into the enclosure should overlap with 
those apertures by a sufficient margin to prevent any leakage of radiations from 
the enclosure. Where a maze is used for the access, a lockable door or barrier 
connected to an interlock should be provided;
vii. Since, dose rates are very high inside the enclosure, during radiography work, 
therefore, it should be designated as a controlled area. However, it is not required 
to be designated as a controlled area when it is not in use;
viii. The enclosure should be designed in such a way that there should be no controlled 
area outside it. However, the area surrounding the shielded enclosure might be 
designated as a supervised area, if situation warrants.
[4] 8.2 Recommendations forSite Radiography 
A great deal of industrial radiography operations are performed without any shielded 
enclosure due to economy, convenience and practical necessity. Such radiography is called as 
site radiography. Particular care should be exercised, during site radiography, to avoid 
unnecessary exposure of workers and individuals in the vicinity and to keep all the exposures 
as low as reasonably achievable. Collimators should be used to the extent practicable to 
restrict the radiation beam to the object being radiographed.
16
The licensee is responsible to implement following precautions for the radiography 
performed in an open site: 
i. Before undertaking site/field radiography, appropriate working rules should be 
established and adhered to at all times;
ii. A set of site working rules should be available at site and the radiography crew 
should ensure that they are familiar with such rules that apply to planned exposure 
situations. Any modifications or additional rules to meet the particular situation 
should be developed in consultation with the RPO;
iii. Before commencing radiography in an open site/field, a well-defined and clearly 
visible boundary should be established using warning signs, barriers, flagged 
rope, etc. The boundary should be located such that the calculated dose rate at the 
boundary during exposure should not exceed the regulatory limit of 10 µSv/hr. 
Actual dose rate at the boundary should be measured during exposure using a 
survey meter and location of the boundary should be rectified as necessary before 
subsequent exposures;
iv. The boundaries of adjacent sites/fields should not overlap each other. If overlap is 
unavoidable; close liaison should be maintained between radiography crew 
responsible for the adjacent sites to avoid accidental exposure;
v. Control panel (or crank) should be placed at such a location that the dose rate 
remains as low as reasonably achievable. During exposure, the radiographer, 
whenever possible, should move quickly to a location where the dose rate does not 
exceed the regulatory limit of 25 µSv/hr. The dose rate at the control panel, if 
occupied, or at the position taken up by the radiographer during exposure should 
be checked regularly by using a survey meter;
vi. Immediate surroundings of the exposure device should be clearly visible from the 
control panel and from the position taken up by the radiographer during exposure. 
The area inside the delineated boundary of an open site/field should be inspected, 
prior to exposure, to ensure that no worker or an individual is inside it. It should be 
kept under observation at all the times during exposure to ensure that no one 
enters into it;
vii. Appropriate warning light(s) and an audible alarm located immediately adjacent 
to the exposure device should be used to indicate that an exposure is underway;
viii. Megaphone should also be made available to warn people in the vicinity not to 
enter the demarked area.
[1] 9 AREACLASSIFICATION AND LOCALRULES 
An area in which work involving radiation source(s) is undertaken is called radiation 
area. It is required to be specifically classified on the bases of potential for exposure to workers 
and individuals working in that area. It is classified into two types namely; controlled area and 
supervised area.
9.1 Controlled Area
The licensee should make arrangements to designate a radiation area as a controlled area 
17
where specific protective measures or safety provisions are required for:
i. Controlling normal exposures;
ii. Preventing or limiting the extent of any potential exposures.
The licensee should ensure that the area where there is a likelihood of receiving an 
effective dose exceeding 6 mSv/year (i.e. 0.69 μSv/hr) or 3/10th of the annual dose limit is 
designated as a controlled area.
9.2 Recommendations forControlled Area
The licensee is responsible to ensure that followings recommendations are followed by 
the radiation workers while working in a controlled area:
i. A controlled area should be physically delineated. The radiation warning signs 
and notices clearly stating “controlled area” should be prominently displayed at 
all access points;
ii. Access to controlled areas should be restricted to authorized persons only. The 
degree of restriction should be commensurate with the magnitude and likelihood 
of potential exposures; 
iii. Workplace monitoring should be carried out all around the controlled area. 
Suitable dose rate monitors (with measuring range from µSv/hr to mSv/hr) should 
be used for this purpose;
iv. Arrangements should be made for calibration and testing of radiation monitoring 
instruments at regular intervals (preferably on annual basis); or as recommended 
by the Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory (SSDL) or any other certified 
service provider;
v. Local rules should be strictly followed, at all times, during the work in a 
controlled area.
9.3 Supervised Area
The licensee should make arrangements to designate a radiation area as a supervised 
area where occupational exposure conditions are required to be kept under review. Even 
though specific protection measures and safety provisions are not normally applied in a 
supervised area, however, exposure conditions should be kept under review.
The licensee should ensure that an area where there is a likelihood of receiving an 
effective dose exceeding one (1) mSv/year (i.e. 0.11 μSv/hr) or equivalent dose greater than 
1/10th of the annual dose limit is designated as a supervised area. 
Usually, all the delineated areas are controlled areas, rather than a supervised area, in 
industrial radiography. Supervised areas mostly exist in case of a radiography in a shielded 
enclosure (room/bunker) rather than the site/field radiography. For example, the area where 
the control panel is situated outside a shielded enclosure may often be classified as a 
supervised area.
18
9.4 Recommendations forSupervised Area
The licensee should ensure that followings recommendations are followed by workers 
while working in a supervised area:
i. The extent of supervised area should also be delineated; 
ii. Appropriate radiation warning signs should be posted at all access points;
iii. Periodic dose-rate monitoring should be carried out in and around the supervised 
area to ensure that working conditions are kept under review;
iv. Established local rules should be followed during the work in a supervised area.
9.5 Local Rules
Local rules are a set of instructions that specify the manner in which the work should be 
carried out to ensure adequate level of protection of worker. All industrial radiography work 
should be carried out in accordance with a set of established local rules. It is responsibility of 
the licensee to establish local rules and ensure their implementation during radiography work. 
The licensee should ensure that these local rules describe their organizational structure and the 
procedures to be followed in a radiation area. These should be set down in writing preferably 
in local language and should be made available to all the workers involved in radiography.
The format and detailed content of local rules may vary among the organizations depending on 
the type of radiography being undertaken and circumstances of work, however, it should 
include the following as a minimum:
i. Identification of individual(s) responsible for supervision of work along with 
their names and designations;
ii. Description of all controlled and supervised areas. For radiography in a shielded 
enclosure this may be specific to the premises where the work is carried out. 
However, for site radiography this may be a general description of conditions 
under which controlled or supervised areas are considered to exist;
iii. General radiation safety procedures and instructions on how work should be 
carried out in order to keep the exposure minimum;
iv. Value of dose investigation level (set by the Licensee/RPO) and corresponding 
actions/procedures to be followed in the event of that level being exceede
v. Emergency plan describing actions to be taken in the event of any reasonably 
foreseeable incident or accident.
[5] 10 STORAGE OFRADIOGRAPHYEQUIPMENTAND SOURCES 
The licensee should ensure that the place where the radiography equipment and the 
sources (i.e. SRS and X-ray generators) are stored, fulfill the following recommendations:
i. Radiography equipment should be kept in a room that is not used for any purpose 
other than for the storage of radiography equipment and its accessories;
19
ii. The storage room should be constructed with the material of sufficient durability 
and strength to resist fire and unauthorized entry;
iii. The dose rate outside the storage room should be as low as reasonably achievable 
and it should be ensured that dose rate inside it is less than 2.5 μSv/h, or any 
member of public will not receive dose exceeding one (1) mSv per year;
iv. The storage room should be under the control of a responsible person (e.g. RPO) 
designated by the licensee and should be kept locked except when removing or 
replacing the radiography equipment and/or sources;
v. The log-book for the issuance of keys should be maintained;
vi. The storage room should have a conspicuous notice bearing the word 
“CAUTION” and a radiation warning sign indicating that it is storage for 
radiography equipment and sources;
vii. The notice, or a separate but adjacent notice, should contain instructions for 
contacting the responsible person (i.e. RPO) in case of an emergency;
viii. The storage room should not be located in proximity to explosives, combustible, 
corrosive materials, or undeveloped photographic films;
ix. Physical security of storage room should also be ensured. The storage room 
should have only one access door, so that it may not be used as a thorough fare.
[3] 11 TRANSPORTOFRADIOGRAPHYSOURCES 
The deliberate physical movement of radioactive material from one place to another is 
called transport. PNRA Regulations on Transport of Radioactive Material - PAK/916 assign 
responsibilities to individuals involved in transport of radioactive materials. These 
individuals include:
i. The consignor (a person or organization that prepares a consignment for 
transport);
ii. The carrier (the person or organization that undertakes transport of radioactive 
material); and 
iii. The consignee (the person or organization that receives a consignment). 
In many cases, for site radiography work, the licensee itself is responsible to perform all 
three functions and is required to discharge the responsibilities associated with each function.
For the transportation of a radioactive material (i.e. radiography sources) within or 
outside the premises, the licensee is responsible to ensure the following:
i. Radiation monitoring should be conducted before, during and after the 
transportation to verify that the source is in a shielded position;
ii. When radiography sources are to be moved within a site, for radiography work, 
they should be kept in the storage facility until they are ready to move to a new 
location. Ancillary equipment should be disconnected from the devices, and all 
required plugs and caps should be installed prior to movement;
20
iii. The sources should be moved only in packages (i.e. exposure devices), and these 
should be locked and keys should be removed. If a vehicle or trolley is used to 
move the package, the package should be stowed or securely fastened to the 
vehicle or trolley so as to prevent any shift under any transport incident. The 
exposure devices should be kept under surveillance for the duration of movement 
on work location;
iv. When sources are to be transported to another work location, for the purpose of 
site radiography, they should be kept in a designated storage facility until they are 
moved to a new location. All ancillary equipment should be disconnected and all 
required plugs and caps should be installed prior to transport;
v. The licensee should ensure that the transport and the transport packages comply 
with the requirements of PAK/916. Where applicable, binding international 
instruments (i.e. codes and standards) for specific modes of transport e.g. by air or 
sea, should also be considered;
vi. The package containing radiography source should be placed in a vehicle in such a 
way that the maximum dose rate for any person traveling in the vehicle shall not 
exceed 20 µSv/h;
vii. The compartment where such package is stowed should be locked and it should 
not be left unattended, if placed in the back of an open vehicle, at any time during 
the transport;
viii. Special arrangements for security of radiography sources, during transport, 
should also be made.
11.1 Actions Following Loss of orDamage to a Package During Transport
If the package containing a radiography source is damaged or appears to be damaged 
during transport, the licensee/owner should immediately take following actions:
i. Person(s) responsible for safety/security of the package, at the time of 
incident/accident, should notify the licensee/owner and the RPO about the 
incident/accident;
ii. The licensee/owner and/or the RPO should ensure that the package is carefully 
examined to verify that it continues to comply with transport requirements. 
Radiation survey should be carried out to ensure that the radiation levels at a 
distance of five (5) cm, at the surface and at one (1) meter from the surface of the 
package are within acceptable range (i.e. category of package). In case if levels 
are exceeded, then the established emergency procedures should be followed [2]; 
iii. If package is lost or theft during transport, the person(s) responsible for its 
safety/security should notify the licensee/owner and the RPO, and provide all 
relevant information that could facilitate an early recovery of the package.
[1] 12 ACCOUNTABILITYOFRADIOGRAPHYSOURCES 
Licensee should make necessary arrangements for the safety and security of the 
radiography sources (i.e. SRS and X-ray generators) so as to prevent the loss, theft, damage 
21
and any unauthorized transfer or access to the sources. An accountability system, for such 
sources, should be established and maintained. 
Formal record containing the following information about the sources, wherever 
applicable, should be retained:
i. Name, identification/serial number, physical form and activity of sources with 
reference date (for SRS only);
ii. Maximum tube potential difference (kV) and current (mA), or maximum X-ray 
energy (keV) and maximum output (dose rate);
iii. Manufacturer, model and identification number of exposure device(s)/package(s) 
and/or X-ray generator(s);
iv. Total number of sources in the custody including in use/disused SRS;
v. Log for issuance and receipt of sources along with name of responsible person 
with dates;
vi. Location of radiography work/site for which the source was issued;
vii. Detail of disposed sources including date and method of disposal.
Through such accountability, the licensee should ensure that the locations of 
radiography sources are known at all times and losses are quickly identified and recovered. 
The record should always be kept updated and should be made available for verification 
during regulatory inspections. An updated inventory sheet of the sources should be submitted 
to the Authority biannually or earlier, if so desired by the Authority. 
13 LEAK TESTING
The purpose of leak testing is to ensure that the sealed radioactive sources remain intact 
and that there is no leakage or dispersal of radioactive material from the housing/casing of the 
source. Radiography sources (i.e. SRS only) should be “leak tested” at regular intervals as 
specified by the Authority. It should be noted that the frequency of the leak test ranges from 
biannually to once in several years. For instance, typical Cobalt-60 sources of activity greater 
than 370 GBq (10 Ci) are leak tested at every six (6) or twelve (12) months interval. Whereas, 
Iridium-192 sources are not normally leak tested because of their short half lives, they are 
typically disused within a year.
[4] 14 EMERGENCYPREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
Ever increasing application of ionizing radiation in industrial radiography requires 
having emergency preparedness and response arrangements in place to cater for the potential 
radiation emergencies associated with it. In industrial radiography, accidents/incidents may 
result in undue exposure of workers and members of the public. PNRA regulations PAK/914 
requires the licensee to develop radiation emergency plan to be implemented during the course 
of an emergency. The purpose of such emergency planning is to control/restrict undue 
exposures As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). 
The concept of emergency preparedness and response is based on following major 
22
components:
i. Assessment of hazards
ii. Preparation of emergency plan and procedure(s)
iii. Acquisition of emergency equipment
iv. Conduct of training drills/exercises 
v. Periodic review of emergency plan and equipment
vi. Incident reporting
14.1 Assessment of Hazards
Emergency planning starts with an assessment of hazard which involves analysis of 
normal operating conditions, foreseeable abnormal conditions (such as equipment 
malfunction/failure, fire, flood, earthquake etc.), all possible types of accidents/incidents and 
their anticipated consequences. Experience feedback and analysis of past accidents/incidents 
in industrial radiography shows that most likely events involving radiography devices 
include, but not limited to, the following:
i. Failure of radiographer to retract the radiography source and/or to perform 
pre/post job area survey
ii. Stuck of source in the guide tube, collimator or near the entrance of the exposure 
container
iii. Malfunctioning or defect in the safety control system
iv. Entry of personnel into the controlled area during the exposure
v. Un-intentionally energizing the X-ray machine
vi. Spread of contamination due to leaked or damaged radiography source(s)
vii. Handling/recovery of lost/stolen radiography source
viii. Damage of radiography source container
ix. Accident during transport of radiography source
All of the events enlisted above usually involve higher dose(s), in access of the 
prescribed dose limits, that may cause localized exposure resulting in severe radiation 
injury(ies).
14.2 Preparation of Radiation Emergency Plan and Procedure(s)
Licensee is responsible to prepare its radiation emergency plan and necessary 
implementing procedure(s) to cater for all the foreseeable types of incidents/emergencies. It 
should be concise and include a description of situations requiring emergency response 
actions. In particular, it should specify immediate actions to be taken, to minimize radiation 
exposure to individuals, in the vicinity of the source/incident.The implementing procedure(s) 
should describe the name(s) of the response officials, their contact details and means of 
communication during on and off working hours. The list of individuals/organizations having 
a role in implementation of the emergency response plan may include the following:
Ÿ Radiation Protection Officer (RPO)
23
Ÿ Qualified Expert
Ÿ PNRA(NRECC/Relevant RNSD)
Ÿ Medical Doctor
Ÿ Local Administration
Ÿ Emergency Services (Rescue 1122, Fire Fighting, Local Police, etc.)
Ÿ Security Incharge of the Facility
The licensee should provide the copy of its approved radiation emergency plan and its 
implementing procedures to all relevant stakeholders.
14.3 Acquisition of Emergency Equipment
The licensee of an industrial radiography facility should acquire/posses sufficient 
equipment to adequately respond to any anticipated emergency situation. This list of 
necessary emergency equipment may vary, however, it is likely to include the items as given in 
the table below:
In addition to the written and approved emergency plan; any supporting documents e.g. 
equipment operation manuals, etc. may also be included with the emergency equipment.
14.4 Conduct of Training Drills/Exercises 
In order to develop the capabilities required to implement radiation emergency plan, the 
licensee should train its staff to deal with the identified emergency situation(s). This training 
may include handling of emergency equipment and implementation of radiation emergency 
plan and its implementing procedure(s). Once this response capability is developed, specific 
drills and full scope emergency exercises should be conducted periodically (preferably once 
in a year). Such exercises not only help in providing training to emergency response workers 
but also test and validate the approved radiation emergency plan of the facility. The schedule 
of these emergency drills/exercises should be communicated to the Authority, well in advance, 
so that the Authority may witness the conduct of such drills/exercises.

14.5 Periodic Review of Emergency Plan and Equipment
The licensee should conduct formal review of emergency plan and implementing 
procedure(s) annually to ensure that:
i. All responsible persons within the facility and relevant off-site organizations 
whose role is anticipated during response to a radiological emergency have been 
identified and their relevant contact details (i.e. telephone numbers and fax 
numbers) are up to date;
ii. Emergency equipment (as enlisted in Section 14.3) is readily available and is 
maintained in operable condition.
Such periodic reviews should take into account the lessons learnt from drills/exercises 
or in response to actual incidents/emergencies and should form the basis for revision/updation 
of emergency response plan and/or its implementing procedures.
14.6 Incident Reporting
The licensee should notify any incident involving radiation source and warranting 
emergency response actions to the Authority through incident reporting performa. Such 
notifications should be followed up by a detailed written incident report that should include 
the following:
i. Description of incident/emergency;
ii. Actions taken to mitigate the situation, to regain the control and to restore the 
conditions to normal;
iii. Root cause of the accident;
iv. Training and experience of the personnel involved;
v. Assessment of exposures (of the personnel involved);
vi. Lessons learnt/ experience feedback;
vii. Recommendations/ corrective actions.
The incident/emergency reports should be prepared by the RPO and approved by the 
management, before submitting to the Authority.

GLOSSARY
(a) "Absorbed Dose" is a measure of energy that is deposited in a material per unit mass 
from any interaction with radiation. It does not take into account the nature of radiation i.e. 
whether it is α, β, gamma, X-ray or neutron.
The S.I. unit of absorbed dose is Joule per Kilogram (J/Kg), termed as Gray and 
abbreviated as Gy.
(b) "Activity" means the amount or strength of radioactive source/material. Activity (A) is 
the number of radioactive atoms (N) disintegrating in a unit time (t). The formal expression is:
A = N / t
S.I. unit of Activity is Becquerel (Bq), which is equal to one disintegration per second. 
These are expressed using a range of prefixes with the basic unit. Common multiples 
(prefixes) associated with activity of the sources used in industrial radiography are given in 
Table-1. The choice of the activity of a source depends on nature of its application.
Although the S.I. unit of activity is Becquerel; however, the older unit i.e. Curie (Ci) is 
still commonly used.
10 1 Ci = 3.7 x 10 Bq = 37 Gbq
(c) "Dose Limits" are the set levels to prevent the occurrence of threshold, deterministic 
effects, and to restrict the probability of occurrence of stochastic effects to very low levels. 
Dose limits as prescribed in Annexure-III of PNRA Regulations on Radiation Protection, 
PAK/904 [1] are reproduced in Table-2 below.
(d) "Dose Rate" is a measure of the dose received at a location over a certain period of time.
Dose rate = Dose / Time
Dose rate is normally expressed in terms of µSv or mSv per hour and may be measured 
with a hand held radiation monitor.

PROTECTION OF PATIENTS IN DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY
ABSTRACT
“Radiology” is the most extensive and commonly used application of ionizing radiation 
and it gives largest amount of radiation dose to the population worldwide. Since, 
radiology is an important tool for diagnosis, therefore, diagnostic procedures have 
become routine part of clinical life and the number of such procedures is ever increasing. 
Keeping in view the diversity of patients and nature of their examinations, dose limits are 
not applicable in diagnostic procedures. In fact, the guidance levels are established for 
radiological procedure so that required clinical information for diagnosis may be 
obtained at a reasonable amount of radiation dose; which is the ultimate goal of 
“optimization in patient doses”.
The patient doses are affected by a number of parameters such as equipments, techniques 
and expertise. This regulatory guide addresses the appropriateness of operating 
parameters such as mAs, kVp and; equipments including grid, collimator and image 
receptors; techniques like general radiography, mammography and fluoroscopy; and 
knowledge/skills of operating personnel. In addition to this, various administrative issues 
such as responsibilities and training of workers have also been addressed in this 
regulatory guide.

1 INTRODUCTION
Medical exposures constitute the largest component of radiation dose to population from 
radiation sources [1]. According to United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of 
Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), there are over 3.6 billion medical radiation imaging 
procedures carried out annually. According to survey conducted by UNSCEAR for the period 
from 1997-2007, total effective dose from medical diagnostic examinations is estimated to 
have increased approximately 70% [2]. The radiation protection is, therefore, becoming 
increasingly important to ensure radiation safety of the patients. PNRA “Regulations on 
Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)" establish dose levels for diagnostic and interventional 
radiology. These guidance levels serve as baseline for the development of protocols for 
minimization of patient doses subject to diagnostic procedures. Dose reduction requires 
careful attention to equipment specifications. Any modifications in operational factors may 
result in variation of dose to patient(s). All attempts should be made to conform to good 
radiation practices and to minimize doses to individual patient.
2 OBJECTIVE
The objective of this regulatory guide is to provide guidance to the licensees of medical 
facilities and describe different ways through which doses can be reduced without 
compromising the diagnostic information.
3 SCOPE
This regulatory guide applies to individuals, practices or facilities where diagnostic or 
interventional diagnostic examinations are performed.
4 PRINCIPLES OFRADIATION PROTECTION AND PATIENTSAFETY
4.1. Justification
Medical exposures should be justified by weighing the diagnostic benefits they produce 
against the radiation detriment they might cause, taking into account the benefits and risks of 
available alternative techniques such as Ultrasonography (USG), Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI), etc.
4.2. Optimization
The optimization of radiation protection and safety, when applied to the exposure of 
workers and members of the public, attendants and comforters of patients undergoing 
radiological procedures, is a process of ensuring that likelihood and magnitude of exposures 
and the number of individuals exposed are As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), with 
economic, societal and environmental factors taken into account. 
In diagnostic radiology, the required clinical information for diagnosis can be obtained 
1
with minimum exposure of patients by taking into account:
Ÿ The relevant information from previous examinations in order to avoid unnecessary 
additional examinations; 
Ÿ Proper selection of equipment and procedures;
Ÿ Qualification and continuous training of workers;
Ÿ Effective quality assurance program; 
Ÿ The relevant guidance levels for medical exposure;
Ÿ Assessment/audits of practices for continuous improvement.
5 RESPONSIBILITIES OFMEDICAL/HEALTH PROFESSIONALS
As per Regulation 35(1)(b) of “Regulations on Radiation Protection - (PAK/904)", "The 
licensee shall ensure that medical professionals are assigned the primary task and obligation of 
ensuring overall patient protection and safety in the prescription of, and during the delivery of, 
medical exposure" [3]. The first step in reduction of patient doses is the availability of a 
qualified Radiologist, Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO) and
Radiographer.
Responsibilities of medical/health professionals regarding protection of patients in 
diagnostic radiology are given below:
5.1. Responsibilities of Radiologist
The radiologist should ensure that:
i. Overall radiation protection of the patient is achieved;
ii. Exposure of the patient is kept to the minimum required to achieve the intended 
objective, taking into account the relevant guidance levels for medical exposure;
iii. Optimized protocols for diagnostic procedures are established;
iv. Guidance is being provided for examination of the pregnant women, pediatric 
patients, medico-legal procedures, and occupational health examinations;
v. Any radiation incident or accident is evaluated and investigated from medical point 
of view;
vi. Qualification and training needs of radiation workers including Medical 
Physicist/RPO and Radiographers are established;
vii. Appropriate training and retraining of radiation workers (i.e. Medical Physicist/RPO 
and Radiographers) is arranged periodically.
5.2. Responsibilities of Medical Physicist/Radiation Protection Officer (RPO)
The Medical Physicist/RPO is responsible for technical and administrative matters 
related to radiation protection at the facility. The Medical Physicist/RPO should ensure:
i. Overall radiation protection of patients at the facility;
2
ii. Development of Radiation Protection and Quality Assurance (QA) Program and 
relevant procedures;
iii. Implementation of regulatory requirements, Radiation Protection and QA Program 
and applicable procedures;
iv. Supervision/conduct of Quality Control (QC) test of X-ray machine(s) and other 
equipment/accessories;
v. Training of workers on radiation safety and radiological protection of patients; 
vi. Maintenance of records relevant to QC of equipment and radiation protection.
5.3. Responsibilities of Radiographer/Operator
The main responsibility of the radiographer/operator is to:
i. Comply with the facility operating procedures;
ii. Identify the patient correctly by:
Ÿ Name;
Ÿ Gender;
Ÿ ID/ CNIC/ Passport Number; and
Ÿ Date of birth, address and any unique patient number.
iii. Verify that the female patient is not pregnant;
iv. Brief the patient(s) about the procedure, correct positioning and immobilization 
during exposure;
v. Use appropriate shielding for patient such as lead apron, gonad shield etc.;
vi. Perform QC tests under the supervision of Medical Physicist.
Additionally, operators should:
i. Be well aware of any dose reduction techniques specific to the equipment; 
ii. Routinely review their work practices to optimize operational protocols.
6 FACTORS AFFECTING DOSES IN X-RAYIMAGING PROCEDURES
 
Factors affecting patient doses in all X-ray imaging procedures include beam energy, 
filtration, collimation, patient size, image processing and expertise of relevant staff. In 
conventional radiography, one of the important determinants of acceptable patient dose is the 
use of accurate peak kilo-voltage (kVp). Digital radiography allows much wider range of 
exposures than conventional radiography for producing diagnostic images. However, 
operators must be aware of subtle differences in techniques used with digital systems to avoid 
unnecessary exposure to patients. Mammography requires lower ranges of kVp; different 
target materials, filters, and screen-film combinations; special attention to breast thickness, 
composition and compression during the study; and different standards for grids, 
magnification and optical density. Although, kVp and tube current are important for 
controlling patient doses in fluoroscopy, however, collimation, source-to-skin and patient-toimage intensifier distances and control of beam-on time also play an important role. Computed 
3
Tomography (CT) involves greater patient doses than conventional radiography. Although, 
primary radiation dose is delivered to smaller volumes, however, dose calculations in CT must 
account for dose received by the adjacent tissue section(s) as well. 
6.1. Radiography
Radiography refers to create a planar image using X-rays. In radiography, Entrance 
Surface Dose (ESD) is very important factor which is proportional to the tube current, the 
length of exposure and the square of kVp. Another factor is inverse square law which states that 
when all other factors are held constant, the dose at any location is inversely proportional to the 
square of the distance from the source.
6.1.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional Radiography.
i. Beam Energy and Filtration: Beam energy primarily depends on kVp selected and 
the amount of filtration in the beam. Selection of higher kVp increases beam 
penetrability. In practice, this may allow for use of a lower tube current or a shorter 
exposure, thereby reducing dose to the patient. It is advisable to use a total filtration 
(which includes the tube wall and any other added filtration) of at least 2.5 mm of 
Aluminum equivalent, if machines are operated at tube potentials above 70 kVp. 
This filtration preferentially absorbs the low energy X-rays in the beam. Without 
filtration, this low energy radiation may completely be absorbed in the patient's body, 
thereby contributing to patient dose without contributing to the image. However, 
added filtration increases the average energy of X-ray beam which results in better 
image quality. 
ii. Collimation: During any diagnostic procedure, the area of patient's body exposed 
should be limited to the area of clinical interest. By using collimation, unnecessary 
patient exposure can be substantially reduced. It has an added effect by reducing the 
area of X-ray beam and the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the image 
receptor thereby increasing the contrast of the final images.
iii. Grid: Grid is used in radiography to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that 
reaches the image receptor, and to improve the image contrast. It, at the same time, 
results in higher patient dose. High quality images, obtained by using grid, may result 
in fewer retakes, however, more accurate diagnosis.
iv. Patient Size: With the increase in thickness of the imaging area, kVp should also be 
increased to obtain required results. Although no control can be exercised over the 
patient size, however, it is beneficial to know the types of exposures expected for 
examinations of different anatomical areas and patients of different sizes. Technique 
charts, that display different radiographic technique factors for various
examinations, displayed near the operator's console may be helpful in this regard.
v. Screen-Film Combinations: Use of a faster screen-film combination can
substantially reduce dose. Faster systems may result in some loss of details.

6.1.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Digital Radiography
Digital Radiography (DR) is the process in which X-ray image is captured through a 
digital image capture device, saved for future record and is made available for interpretation or 
further assessment. The advantages of DR over film include; immediate image preview and 
availability, a wider dynamic range which makes it more forgiving for over and under exposure 
as well as the ability to apply special image processing techniques that enhance overall display 
of the image. The largest motivator for healthcare facilities to adopt DR is its potential to 
reduce costs associated with processing, managing and storing films.
In digital radiography, there is a trade-off between image quality, noise, and patient dose. 
Efforts to reduce radiation doses during imaging studies have been traditionally limited by a 
lower image quality, but the use of digital modalities may offer an opportunity to reduce 
exposure with images of adequate quality. Many approaches are available to acquire better 
image quality with minimum possible exposures. One way is to increase kVp with 
corresponding decrease in milliampere-seconds (mAs) product. This technique increases 
beam penetration thereby providing adequate exposure to image receptors while reducing 
relative absorption in patient and therefore, reducing patient dose.
6.2 Mammography
Mammography is an X-ray examination of the breast. It is the most reliable method of 
detecting breast cancer. Its principal purpose is to facilitate the detection of breast cancer at a 
point earlier in its natural history than is possible by clinical examination. The factors that 
affect diagnostic radiography also apply to mammography. However, it involves different 
parameters because of different nature of the tissue being imaged. Generally, the term 
“Average Glandular Dose" (AGD) is used to describe the dose to a breast tissue in 
mammography.
6.2.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Mammography
i. Beam Energy: The mammographic range of peak kVp is much lower than that used 
for all other applications of radiography because high contrast is required to image 
the soft breast tissues. Small differences in beam energy in mammography greatly 
affect the resulting dose to the patient. 
ii. Target Material: Different target materials yield X-rays of different energies, 
therefore, patient dose is affected when different target materials are used. 
Molybdenum which emits characteristic X-rays of approximately 18 and 20 kV is 
used as a target material. Recently, Rhodium which emits characteristic X-rays of 
approximately 23 kV is being used for imaging thick or dense breasts. Tungsten has 
also been used as a target material. It is useful while imaging thick and dense breast 
tissues.
iii. Filter Material: Filters are used to shape the X-ray energy spectrum. Filters absorb 
5
low energy X-rays that do not contribute to image formation and high energy X-rays 
that would degrade image contrast. In mammography, imaging is performed at the 
characteristic energy of the target material. Therefore, to avail characteristic energy 
peak of the target material, same material is used as a filter. For example, 
Molybdenum and Rhodium are used as filter materials along with Molybdenum and 
Rhodium targets respectively. Molybdenum selectively filters out a high percentage 
of X-rays with energies more than 20 kV and Rhodium X-rays with energies more 
than 23 kV. Rhodium filters result in more penetrating X-ray beam and can provide a 
substantial dose reduction when imaging thick, dense breast tissues.
iv. Grid: In mammography, grid is used to reduce the amount of scattered radiation that 
reaches the image receptor. The bucky factor for mammography grid is usually in the 
range of 2-3.
v. Magnification: Magnification can be an excellent tool for imaging very small breast 
lesions but it also increases the AGD. Magnification is achieved by moving the breast 
further away from the image receptor and closer to the X-ray tube. The increase in the 
distance of breast from the image receptor and the fact that grid is removed during 
magnification results in increased AGD.
vi. Breast Thickness and Tissue Composition: Thickness and composition of breast 
tissues have substantial impact on patient dose. High energy X-ray beam and longer 
exposure time are required to obtain acceptable images in case of thick and dense 
breast tissue and hence results in high AGD.
vii. Compression: Compression of the breast tissue results in a lower AGD as the 
thickness is reduced. It also results in more uniform exposure to the breast.
viii. Image Optical Density: Optical Density (OD) refers to the darkness, or density of the 
exposed film. If greater optical density is required, more exposure will be needed. 
Increasing the optical density of films results in higher AGD to patients.
ix. Screen-Film Combinations: Screen-film combinations of various speeds can also be 
used in mammography. As in mammograms, greater detail is required, therefore, a 
slower screen-film combination is used which results in a higher AGD.
6.3 Fluoroscopy
Fluoroscopy is used to obtain real-time images for diagnostic purposes and to get 
guidance for other medical procedures.
6.3.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Fluoroscopy
i. Beam Energy and Tube Current: Beam energy (kVp) as well as tube current (mA) 
plays an important role in patient dose. Higher kVp and lower tube current results in 
more penetrating beam. Increasing tube current results in increasing the number of 
photons which ultimately yield to increasing patient dose. Maintaining the highest 
kVp that will produce acceptable image contrast leads to lower patient dose.
ii. Collimation: In fluoroscopy collimators are important in considerations of the patient 
6
dose. Extended “beam-on” time may be used in fluoroscopy which may result in 
substantially higher doses to the areas surrounding the area of clinical interest. This 
potential overexposure can easily be avoided by using small field size required to 
image the area of interest only. Proper collimation also reduces the contribution of 
scattered radiation and leads to higher quality images.
iii. Source-to-Skin Distance:The dose rate of a fluoroscopic X-ray beam as it exits the Xray tube is extremely high. Increasing the source-to-skin distance decreases the dose 
to patient. Maintaining the maximum possible distance between X-ray source and 
the patient body is the most effective means of reducing patient dose.
iv. Patient-to-Image Intensifier Distance: Distance between the patient and the image 
intensifier also has substantial effect on patient dose. By decreasing the distance, the 
dose rate of the X-ray beam can be reduced. Decrease in dose rate results in lower 
cumulative dose to the patient. However, minimizing this distance also means that a 
large fraction of scattered radiation will contribute to image. It is widely accepted, 
however, that minimizing patient-to-image intensifier distance is the most preferred 
method to reduce patient dose.
v. Image Magnification: Image magnification results in higher patient dose. 
Magnification can be achieved by two means, namely; geometric and electronic. 
Geometric magnification is obtained by moving the image intensifier further away 
from the patient, by moving the X-ray source closer to the patient or both. In 
electronic magnification of the image, the size of X-ray beam may be restricted to 
impinge on a portion of the image intensifier only. This technique usually produces 
an increase in patient dose, although to a smaller degree than geometric 
magnification.
vi. Grid: Use of grid in fluoroscopy reduces the amount of scattered radiation and yields 
images with improved contrast. Patient doses, however, increase by a factor of two or 
more. In some cases grids may be removed without a substantial loss in image 
contrast e.g. when the patient is small and when the patient-to-image intensifier 
distances is sufficiently large.
vii. Patient Size:Thick patient or dense areas within patient body cause more X-ray beam 
to be absorbed or scattered. The backscatter factor also contributes to an increased 
ESD in thicker patients. Operators should realize that ESD accumulates more rapidly 
in obese patients making them more susceptible to radiation burns.
viii. Beam–On Time: The amount of dose delivered to a patient is directly proportional to 
the amount of time the X-ray source is energized, creating a real time image. Use of 
short intermittent exposures rather than extended continuous exposures also reduce 
patient dose. Keeping beam-on time to a minimum is the most effective way to 
reduce the patient dose. It is advisable to maintain written records of beam-on times. 
These records may prove useful if patient doses are to be estimated.
6.3.2 Patient Doses in Fluoroscopy
The dose rate to a patient in fluoroscopy is greatest at the skin. The entrance exposure 
7
limit for standard operation of a fluoroscope is 25 mGy/min for normal and 100 mGy/min for 
high level operation mode [3].
Appropriate protocols should be available at every facility for physicians to minimize 
doses to the patients in order to avoid deterministic effects (e.g. burns) and occurrence of 
stochastic effects (e.g. cancer).
6.4 Computed Tomography (CT)
CTstands for computed tomography. The CTscan can reveal anatomic details of internal 
organs that cannot be seen in conventional X-rays. The X-ray tube spins rapidly around the 
patient and the X-rays strike numerous detectors after passing through the body. These 
detectors are connected to sophisticated computers which generate images after image 
processing. The radiation dose of a CT scanner is much higher than a conventional X-ray, but 
the information obtained from a CTscan is often much greater.
Two most commonly reported doses for CT are those delivered during head and body 
scans. Currently, in latest equipment available in the market, CT Dose Index (CTDI) values are 
usually provided by the manufacturers.
Generally, in CT scan, Multi Scan Average Dose (MSAD) ranges from 40 – 60 mGy (4-6 
rad) for head scans and from 10 – 40 mGy (1-4 rad) for body scans. Whereas, a scout scan 
usually results in a surface dose of approximately 1 mGy (100 mrad) [4].
6.4.1 Factors Affecting Dose in Conventional CT
i. Beam Energy and Filtration: Radiation dose in diagnostic radiology mainly depends 
on beam energy; the higher the beam energy for an exposure, the higher will be the 
patient dose. Use of most appropriate kVp for a given examination is important to 
keep patient doses minimum. The type of filter placed in the X-ray beam also plays 
an important role in resulting beam energy in CT. These filters may be shaped to 
present different thicknesses at different points across the X-ray beam. The type of 
filter used for a specific CT examination is usually determined by the manufacturer 
and can reduce the ratio of surface dose to midline dose.
ii. Collimation: Collimation of X-ray beam plays a significant role in patient doses in 
CT. Effective utilization of pre-patient collimators confine the beam to section 
thickness intended at the area of interest and keep the doses minimum to the adjacent 
tissues. Another set of collimators may be positioned post-patient or pre-detector to 
reduce the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the detector. Images with better 
contrast and resolution are obtained through this technique which may affect patient 
dose indirectly.
iii. Number and Spacing of Adjacent Sections: Patient dose in CT is also affected by the 
number and spacing of adjacent sections. When more sections are scanned, more 
volume of tissue is irradiated. The MSAD may increase because of the penumbra 
8
resulting from scattered radiation and possible beam divergence. With the increase 
in ratio between section thickness and section interval, the MSAD also increases 
because of increasing contributions from neighboring sections.
iv. Image Quality and Noise: Statistical noise and loss of image contrast as a result of 
scattered radiation are most important factors affecting image quality. The dose used 
to acquire the image increases with the decrease in noise. To maintain acceptable 
levels of noise, the kVp and tube current used to acquire the image may need to be 
increased.
6.4.2 Factors Affecting Dose in Spiral CT
In spiral CT, continuous scanning of patient while the couch is moving through the 
scanner is possible. A large volume of the tissue can be scanned in a relatively short time in 
spiral CT. All the variables of traditional CT also apply to spiral CT, however, scan pitch is an 
additional important factor that must be considered in spiral CT.
Pitch is a ratio of distance that patient's couch travels during 360º gantry rotation to the 
section thickness. If the couch travels 10 mm during one rotation and the section thickness is 
10 mm, the pitch would be 1 (one). The larger the pitch, more tissue can be imaged during the 
same scan interval.
For a spiral CT examination with a pitch of 1 (one), the dose to patient should be 
comparable with the dose delivered in a traditional CTof the same volume of the tissue. Patient 
dose is inversely proportional to pitch, as the pitch is increased, the dose at any point along the 
volume of tissue decreases and vice versa.
6.5 Dental Radiology
Dental radiography is the process of taking the X-ray images (pictures) of a teeth, bones, 
and soft tissues around them to help find problems with the teeth. It is one of the most frequent 
type of radiology procedures performed. Although, exposure associated with dental radiology 
is relatively low, however, radiological procedure should be justified and optimized to keep 
the radiation risk as low as reasonably possible. In dental radiology, ESD without backscatter 
for intraoral examinations and the Dose Width Product (DWP) for panoramic examinations is 
recommended for the setting of Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) [5].
6.5.1 Factors Contributing Dose Variation 
i. Collimation, Field- Size Trimming: Rectangular collimation which approximates the 
size and shape of the receptor reduces the dose significantly in comparison with 
circular collimation. A dose reduction exceeding 60% can be achieved in dental 
radiology by using rectangular collimation.
ii. Choice of Image Receptor: Digital detectors have the potential for further dose 
reduction, even compared with F-speed film, provided the repeat rate and use of 
9
higher exposure factors than necessary are controlled. The fastest available film 
consistent with achieving satisfactory diagnostic results should be used. E-speed and 
F-speed films reduce doses more than 50% compared with D-speed films.
iii. X-ray Generation and Kilo-voltage: For dental radiology, 65-70 kV is recommended 
as kilo-voltage of choice in intraoral X-ray sets using AC equipment, with 60 kV for 
those using DC X-ray sets.
iv. Filtration: X-ray tube filtration should be sufficient to reduce entrance surface dose 
to the patient consistent with producing satisfactory image quality. Filtration by 
aluminum is a key method of reducing skin dose to patients.
v. Position Indication Device: A position indication device which ensures minimum 
focus-to-skin distance of 20 cm should be attached to the tube head (e.g. by use of a 
long collimator/cone as compared to a short conical one).
6.6 In Utero Exposure in Diagnostic Radiography
PNRARegulations on Radiation Protection (PAK/904), requires medical practitioners to 
avoid exposure to abdomen or pelvis of women patients who are or likely to be pregnant. If the 
exposure to any other body part or even to the abdomen/pelvis is justified, the medical 
practitioner is required to plan and conduct the exposure appropriately. 
6.6.1 Factors Affecting Fetal Dose in Diagnostic Radiography
i. Direct (inside field of view) Exposure: If a fetus is located within the field of view of a 
particular examination, such as studies of the abdomen, pelvis and lumbar spine, it is 
exposed directly to primary beam radiation. This situation typically results in the 
highest fetal doses. Shielding in such situations becomes ineffective because it 
cannot cover the area being imaged.
ii. Indirect (outside field of view) Exposure: In case of examinations of skull and 
extremities, bulk of the exposure received by a fetus is from indirect scattered 
radiation from maternal tissues. The dose received in this situation is lower than the 
direct exposure. Shielding in this situation is again of limited value as most of the 
fetal dose results from internal scatter in the mother.
6.6.2 Fetal Dose Estimation in Diagnostic Radiography 
Fetal doses are estimated using the following imaging techniques:
i. Output intensity (measured in exposure or air kerma) of the X-ray equipment for 
diagnostic exposures, entrance exposure (or air kerma rate) and fluoroscopic 
exposures, along with the conditions of the examination should be known;
ii. The Half-Value Layer (HVL) should be used to determine beam penetrability;
iii. Information about the conditions of procedure should include the location, number 
of images taken and radiographic exposure factors;
iv. For fluoroscopic procedures, the beam-on time and number of digital or cassette spot 
images taken should also be known;
10
v. Patient information should include fetal age at the time of exposure, patient's size 
and thickness, depth of fetus, and orientation of patient.
According to the data published in the Article of Radiographics [4], estimated doses to 
uterus from typical diagnostic procedures are listed in the Table-1.
The medical/health professionals at a diagnostic radiology facility should be aware of 
the effect of the factors/technical parameters such as KVp, mAs, collimation etc. on dose and 
image quality and they should select appropriate parameters, as relevant, such that their 
combination produce the minimum patient exposure consistent with the acceptable image 
quality and clinical purpose of the examination.
6.7 Film Processing
Patients may undergo repeated X-ray examinations after their initial X-ray radiographs 
are rejected due to poor image quality. Good quality of radiographs cannot be acquired without 
proper film processing.
In manual processing, technical factors, such as developer temperature, developing time 
and chemistry replenishment, affect the quality of the films and are much more difficult to 
control. The darkrooms, in manual processing, should be equipped with a timer and

thermometer, and a time-temperature development table which should be followed for 
processing all the films.
Automatic film processing is preferred because of less processing time. The film 
processor should be used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. If temperature, 
transport rate or replenishment rates differ substantially from the recommended values, the 
effects on the image quality can be significant which may lead to modification of radiographic 
techniques that in turn directly affect patient's dose.
Film processing conditions are also important in mammography. Manufacturer's 
recommendations for processing should be strictly followed. Deviations can lead to use of 
improper exposure techniques thereby increasing the patient dose. Another consideration is 
the length of film-processing cycle which can be either standard or extended. Extended cycle 
and processing allows a decrease in dose required to produce acceptable images. However, not 
all mammography films are compatible with extended-cycle processing.
7 MANAGING PATIENTDOSES
The factors affecting the management of patient doses are described in the following 
sections:
7.1 Developments in Equipments and Accessories
Technical development that made most significant contribution to patient dose 
reduction is the intensifying screen. From direct film radiography to modern rare earth 
phosphors (typically Oxysulphides or Oxybromides of Gadolinium and Lanthanum), dose 
reduction of a factor of 15-500 have been made possible, depending upon the type of screen 
and film used. Rare earth screens have three to five times better dose efficiency as compared to 
Calcium Tungstate screens which are still in common use [7]. Spectral sensitivity of a film 
should match the emission spectrum of the intensifying screen used. Any mismatch will have 
financial implications and it may lead to increased radiation doses to the patients. There is thus 
an immediate scope for dose reduction by switching over to rare earth screens.
Equipment with unsatisfactory safety and quality features should not be operated. Type 
approval of X-ray machines and registration may serve as an efficient method of ensuring 
conformity to specifications. New X-ray equipments may have malfunctions in one or more of 
their radiological parameters including; kVp, timing, beam congruence or centering and milliampere second linearity of some of their mechanical parameters which can be detected by 
acceptance testing. A qualified person, preferably a radiology medical physicist, may use 
these tests to verify that the initial performance of the equipment conforms to the 
manufacturer's specifications and international standards [8,9]. The person testing the 
equipment should thoroughly document the results of acceptance tests as those results might 
be used in part to define the acceptable range of parameters that will be monitored in any 
subsequent test. If no acceptance testing is carried out, there are 80% chances of starting with a 
12
13
poorly functioning unit.
After successful installation and acceptance of equipment, QC testing of the equipment 
must be carried out on an ongoing basis for continued and reliable performance. A medical 
physicist should perform QC testing of the equipment at a defined frequency to look for 
changes that may cause degradation of image quality or an increase in radiation exposure to 
patient.
Moreover, maintenance policy should be established for the maintenance of older 
equipment to avoid unnecessary exposures. Replacing/changing some of the accessories may 
also result in a patient dose reduction. Considerable attention should be given to introduction 
of Carbon fibers in table tops. Typically the dose can be reduced by 3-15% by changing the 
table top, 6-12% by changing the front of film cassette and 20-30% by using a grid with carbon 
fiber covers and fiber interspaces [10]. 
7.2 Referrals
Radiological examination is advised by the physicians to establish a diagnosis, however, 
not all the diagnostic examinations are clinically helpful. Expertise of physician, referring 
diagnostic examination, can help in saving the potential collective dose. Evidence based 
medicine has become an accepted practice, along with evidence based radiology.
The referring physician bears special responsibility and should use guidelines for 
diagnosis to a greater extent. The referring physician should take into account all clinical 
aspects regarding management of every patient individually/separately. In difficult cases, they 
should also consult with their colleagues in radiology in the selection of the most suitable 
procedure. Other possible procedures with lower or no exposure, such as USG or MRI, should 
be considered, if and when appropriate, before proceeding to radiological procedures.
7.3 Education and Training
The personnel involved in advice and delivery of any radiology examination should be 
qualified and receive adequate training. The role played by training and education must be 
emphasized when it comes to the dose reductions possible in the hands of operators, 
developing expertise to advice manufacturers, making the right choice of equipment at the 
time of purchase and spreading a culture of radiation protection among the personnel. A
substantial dose reduction (nearly 40%) can be achieved by training of the staff. This is the 
responsibility of the licensee to plan and execute effective training and re-training programs 
for its workers.
7.4 Dose Guidance Levels
Patient doses in diagnostic examinations are controlled by restricting dose up to a certain 
level, specific for an examination, suggesting that the dose is sufficient to create better quality 
14
image of human anatomy. Dose guidance levels have been replaced by dose reference levels in 
recent recommendations of ICRP on radiation protection [11]. The dose guidance levels for 
conventional radiography, computed tomography and mammography are given in Table-2, 
Table-3 and Table-4 respectively [3]. 
Notes: PA: posterior-anterior projection; LAT: lateral projection; LSJ: lumbo-sacral-joint projection; 
AP: anterior-posterior projection.
* In air with backscatter, these values are for conventional film-screen combination in the 
relative speed of 200. For high speed film-screen combinations (400- 600), the values should be 
reduced by a factor of 2 to 3.

Dose guidance levels have been established through worldwide survey practices. With 
the improvement of imaging technology, the radiation doses in an examination can be 
significantly reduced with good image quality. Furthermore, better performance and selection 
of proper technique in the same examination for different human beings further reduce the 
population dose. Many countries all over the world perform periodic surveys to assess the 
patient doses in diagnostic examinations. On the basis of the results thus obtained, the 
guidance levels are revised to lower doses.
7.5 Clinical Dosimetry in Radiology
Radiation protection of patients undergoing medical X-ray examinations is governed by 
the principles of justification and optimization. Radiation dosimetry is required to inform 
medical practitioners of the levels of exposure and hence the risks associated with the 
diagnostic procedures that they have to justify and to assist the operators of X-ray imaging 
equipment to determine whether their procedures are optimized. The dosimetric quantities to 
be considered during diagnostic work are:
Ÿ ESD for individual radiographs;
Ÿ Dose-Area Product (DAP) for individual radiographs;
Ÿ DAPfor complete examinations involving radiography and/or fluoroscopy;
Ÿ Weighted CT Dose Index (CTDIw) per slice in spiral CT scanning or per rotation in 
helical CTscanning;
Ÿ Dose-Length Product (DLP) per complete CTexamination.
7.5.1 Entrance Surface Dose
It is the entrance air Kerma with backscatter from patient skin. It is usually expressed in 
milligray (mGy) and can be measured directly with suitably calibrated TLDs attached to the 
patient's skin or with ionization chambers supported in free air on the X-ray beam axis, 
corrected to the Focus Skin Distance (FSD) and by a suitable backscatter factor. It is the 
quantity of more concern for practical patient dosimetry. Specific X-ray tube output 
measurements, as a function of tube voltage (kV) and charge (mAs) made during routine 
quality assurance programs, are frequently used to calculate ESD values from the exposure 
parameters (kV, mAs, FSD) used for radiographs on a particular patient [12].

3 (with grid)
Table-4: Dose Guidance Levels for Mammography
7.5.2 Dose Area Product
It is the absorbed dose to air (or the air kerma) averaged over the area of X-ray beam in a 
plane perpendicular to the beam axis, multiplied by the area of beam (A) in the same plane. It is 
usually expressed in Gy-cm2 and being invariant with distance from X-ray tube focus, it is 
conveniently measured with special large area ionization chambers (DAP meters) attached to 
the diaphragm housing of the X-ray tube, which intercept the entire cross section of the beam. 
They essentially integrate the absorbed dose over whole beam area for any number of 
diagnostic or fluoroscopic exposures and can thus provide a single measurement of total 
amount of radiation used in a complete X-ray examination involving radiography and 
fluoroscopy. DAPmeters should be calibrated after installation on an X-ray set to take account 
of the particular scatter conditions and attenuating material between the DAP meter and the 
patient (e.g. the table top for under-couch X-ray tubes) [12].
7.5.3 CT Dose Index
The principal dosimetric quantity used in CT is the CTDI. This is defined as the integral 
along a line parallel to the axis of rotation (z) of the dose profile [D(z)] for a single rotation and 
a fixed table position, divided by the nominal thickness of the X-ray beam. CTDI can be 
conveniently assessed using a pencil ionization chamber with an active length of 100 mm, so 
as to provide a measurement of CTDI100, expressed in terms of absorbed dose to air (mGy) 
[13]. 
Where "n" is the number of tomographic slices, each of nominal thickness "T", imaged 
during a single rotation.
7.6 Assessment of Exposure to the Patient at Individual X-ray Facilities
Patient exposure assessment should always be associated with monitoring image 
information. Patient exposure and image quality assessments at individual facilities should be 
carried out on a sample of typical patients.
Assessment of patient doses serve the following purposes:
i. Establishing guidance levels (reference levels);
ii. Comparing doses and dose distributions for the same type of examination, done with 
different exposure parameters or with different equipment, or in different X-ray 
rooms or different hospitals or different countries, or to monitor improvement by 
making comparisons before and after changes;
iii. Comparing patient exposure for different types of examinations. Effective dose is, 
therefore, used for comparison; however, the caution of using effective doses for 
patients as indicated in UNSCEAR should be kept in mind;
iv. Assessing relative contributions to collective doses from various types of 
examinations or even comparing medical with non-medical radiation exposure of 
16
the population;
v. Analyzing trends in the use of radiation e.g. change in frequency and dose per 
examination, introduction of new examination techniques or modification of 
techniques; and
vi. Comparison of patient doses with guidance levels to get an idea if doses are on the 
high side.

GLOSSARY
ABSORBED DOSE: It is a measure of energy deposited per unit mass and it is measured in 
units of Gray(Gy) or milli-gray (mGy). 
BUCKY FACTOR (B): It is the ratio of x-rays arriving at the grid (incident radiation) and 
those being transmitted through the grid. 
DOSE LENGTH PRODUCT:It is the CTDI multiplied by the scan length in centimeters.
ENTRANCE SURFACE DOSE (ESD): It is defined as "the entrance air kerma with 
backscatter from the patient skin".
EXPOSURE: It refers to the amount of energy initially transferred from incident X-rays to 
charged particles per unit mass of air and it is measured in Roentgen ®.
HALF-VALUE LAYER (HVL): It is thickness of the material at which the intensity of 
radiation entering is reduced by one half. 
KERMA: (Kinetic energy released in matter) is defined as the amount of energy transferred 
from the incident X-rays to charged particles per unit mass in the medium of interest. The unit 
of air kerma is same as the unit of absorbed dose i.e. Gray or milli-Gray.
MULTIPLE SCAN AVERAGE DOSE (MSAD): It is the dose from a multiple scan 
examination, averaged over one scan interval in the central portion of the multiple-scan dose 
profile.
TISSUE OR ORGAN DOSE: It refers to radiation absorbed dose delivered to the tissues or 
organs of a patient during a radiology examination.
